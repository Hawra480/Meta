"Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis; A Seroepidemiological Survey in Jiroft District, Southern Kerman Province, Southeastern Iran in 2015","Background: Domestic dogs have been implicated as the main reservoir host of Mediterranean type of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) that is endemic in some parts of Iran. This study was performed about role of dogs in canine VL (CVL) epidemiology in Jiroft District, south of Kerman Province, southeastern Iran. Methods: Totally, 165 dogs including 100 stray and 65 sheepdogs were randomly selected. After complete clinical examination blood sample was taken from each dog. All the collected samples were examined following the serum separation by direct agglutination test (DAT) for detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies. The titers of >= 1:320 were defined as positive. Results: Overall, of 165 serum samples, 13 samples (7.9%) were positive by DAT at titers of >= 1:320. The seroprevalence was 11% among the stray dogs and 3% among the sheepdogs. There was no significant difference between stray and sheepdogs in CVL infection. The highest seroprevalence rate (14.3%) was found in seven-year old dogs. Conclusion: The present finding indicates the role of stray and sheepdogs in CVL epidemiology in this area. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the status of VL infection in human subjects in this area."
"Epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis in the Jenin district, West Bank: 1989-1998","Fifty patients from rural areas in the Jenin district of the West Bank, Palestinian Authority, were diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) between 1989 and 1998. Forty-nine (98%) were younger than 6 years old, the youngest being 9 months. The yearly incident rate of VL in the Jenin district was highest in 1994 (11.8/100,000) and decreased to 1.5/100,000 in 1998; a mortality rate of 4% was recorded. Seventeen (5.5%) of 308 dogs from the Jenin and Ramallah districts of the West Bank were seropositive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a survey of canine leishmaniasis. Although all the leishmanial strains cultured from humans and dogs were identified as Leishmania infantum by a species-specific polymerase chain reaction. further genetic analysis by restriction fragment length polymorphism of kinetoplast DNA revealed patterns of polymorphism within isolates. The findings indicate that an active focus of potentially fatal VL exits in the Jenin district of the West Bank and that the parasite. vector. and reservoir host are found in this area. The epidemiology of VL in that vicinity follows the pattern of a predominantly infantile disease traditionally found in Middle Eastern countries, without a considerable involvement of immunocompromised adults infected with HIV virus as reported in other regions."
An epidemiological study of intestinal parasitosis and Chagas' disease in Japanese descendants and Paraguayan villages in Paraguay,"The prevalence of parasitic infection was studied in November and December 1996 for the residents (0.3-76 years of age,217 in total) of Japanese descendant colonies(la Colmena and Pirap) and Paraguayan villages(It Potrer and Calle Poi,Paraguar Department, endemic areas of Chagas' disease). It was found that 8(22-72 years of age)out of 217(3.7%) residents on the whole were positive for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies (IgG fraction) with no infected children. The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was also studied for the same residents, showing that 126 out of 317( 58.1%) residents were infected with a high prevalence of Giardia lambria (24.4%) and Necator americanus (19.4%). As for the infection rates for the latter in each area, a marked difference was observed between Japanese descendants (7.7%) and Paraguayan residents (22.1%) in Pirap, indicating the infuluence of the differences of usual daily habits and hygenical consciousness between each group."
"Bovine trypanosomosis and vector density in Omo-Ghibe tsetse belt, South Ethiopia","African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) is a parasitic disease that causes serious economic losses in livestock from anemia, loss of condition, emaciation and death in untreated cases. It is one of the major constraints to improved livestock production and productivity in Ethiopia. Entomological and parasito-logical surveys were conducted in the Omo-Ghibe tsetse belt of south Ethiopia to estimate the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis and the apparent tsetse density (AD), and identify the potential risk factors. For the parasitological study, blood samples were collected from 1508 cattle sampled from 11 districts and assayed using the buffy coat technique and Giemsa-stained thin smears. For the entomological survey, a total of 216 biconical and NGU traps were deployed in all districts. The overall animal-level prevalence of trypanosomosis was 7.8% (95% Cl: 6.5, 9.3). The trypanosome species identified were Trypanosoma congolense (75.4%), T. vivax (20.3%), T. brucei brucei (1.7%) and mixed T. congolense/T. vivax (2.6%). Regarding the entomological survey result, a total of 2243 tsetse flies were captured which identified to be Glossina pallidipes (85.1%) and G. f fuscipes (14.9%). Besides, other biting flies of the genus Stomoxys (n =146) and Tabanus (n=17) were also trapped. The AD noted in the present study was 3.5 flies/trap/day. Both the prevalence of trypanosomosis and AD of tsetse flies were significantly (p < 0.05) influenced by altitude. The prevalence of trypanosomosis was also significantly (p <0.05) associated with poor body condition score, black coat color and lower mean packed cell volume while no significant prevalence difference was noted along with age and sex category. In conclusion, the present study suggested that trypanosomosis is an important disease of cattle in the Omo-Ghibe tsetse belt in dry season. The disease is mainly caused by the most pathogenic T. congolense and transmission is predominantly by tsetse flies, particularly G. pallidipes. The study warrants the need for strengthening the vector and parasite control interventions in the area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
A cross-sectional study of trypanosomosis and its vectors in donkeys and mules in Northwest Ethiopia,"A preliminary study was conducted in January 2009 in four peasant associations (PAs) selected from two districts in Benishangul Gumuz Regional State, Northwest Ethiopia to investigate the prevalence and species of trypanosomes infecting donkeys and mules and identify the fly vectors playing a role in the transmission of trypanosomosis. Blood samples were collected from a total of 334 donkeys and 52 mules and examined by dark ground/phase contrast buffy coat technique and Giemsa-stained blood smears. Accordingly, trypanosome species were encountered in 6.3% of the examined donkeys (n = 21) while none of the mules examined was positive for trypanosome infection. Trypanosomes and tsetse flies were detected in two of the four PAs surveyed (Tsetsa adurno and Bamadone) with significant (P = 0.004) difference in prevalence. The inability to find trypanosomes in the other two PAs (Ura and Ashura) was most likely due to the absence of appropriate fly vectors. Three species of trypanosomes were detected in donkeys, which in order of predominance were Trypanosoma congolense (52.4%), Trypanosoma brucei (28.6%), and Trypanosoma vivax (19.05%). There was a significant (P = 0.008) difference in mean PCV between trypanosome infected and non-infected donkeys. The body condition score of the donkeys was significantly associated with both prevalence of infection (P = 0.009) and mean packed cell volume (PCV; P < 0.0001). No significant difference was observed between male and female donkeys regarding both prevalence of infection and mean PCV (P > 0.05 for each factor). The entomological surveys revealed the presence of Glossina morsitans submorsitans and other biting flies of the family Stomoxys, Tabanus, and Haematopota. In conclusion, the prevalence of trypanosomosis obtained in the current study is generally low compared to previous studies. As the present study design was a cross-sectional, one that only depicts a momentary picture of the infection status in the herd, a further longitudinal study that makes use of more sensitive techniques and entomological survey is recommended."
Prevalence of Surra among camels and horses in Jordan,"The prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection among camels and horses in Jordan was studied using thick blood smears and inoculation techniques with mice and rats. A total of 437 camels and 83 horses from four climatic zones were surveyed. In addition, 40 donkeys, 32 cattle and 35 goats in contact with infected camels and horses were also tested in the same way. Clinical disease was evident in 8.2% of the camels (36 out of 437) and in 9.6% of the horses (8 out of 83). Infection was limited only to the Sweama area on the Dead Sea (within the warm desert-climatic zone), with prevalence of 30.5% and 33.3%, respectively, for camels and horses. Donkeys, cattle and goats examined were all free from ir: evansi. Clinically affected camels were positive by both, thick blood smear and mouse and rat inoculations. Rat and mouse inoculations revealed (X-2=3.2, df=1, exact p=0.07) greater number of positive cases in horses than those revealed by thick blood smears. ir: evansi-infected camels and horses showed all the clinical signs known for Surra. In addition, it was observed that 100% of infected camels stared at the sun. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
Phenotypic diversity of Triatoma infestans at the microgeographic level in the gran chaco of Argentina and the Andean valleys of Bolivia,"Triatoma infestans (Klug) is the main vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, etiologic agent of Chagas disease. The phenotype of the species varies at different geographic scales. The objective of this study was to compare the antennal phenotype of spatially close T infestans populations and to evaluate its usefulness as a marker of exchange of individuals between populations. The antennal phenotype of 190 T. infestans from Argentina and Bolivia was analyzed using uni- and multivariate techniques. This study shows heterogeneity of the antennal phenotypes of closely related T. infestans populations living in different habitats. Specimens collected in a goat corral and a rabbit cage in La Rioja (Argentina) were dissimilar to the specimens collected in the nearby intradomestic environment. Similarly, specimens from peridomestic corrals in Cochabamba (Bolivia) were different from the intradomestic and sylvatic specimens, indicating some degree of isolation between these populations. In contrast, T. infestans collected in chicken coops and the intradomestic environment were similar, in all studied regions, suggesting a frequent exchange of individuals between the two habitats and/or because of the similarity of the habitat due to the presence of chickens in the intradomestic environment. We propose that each habitat affects in a particular mode the insect morphology and these changes could be used to identify recolonizing T. infestans. These results support the hypothesis of different degrees of isolation between intradomestic and peridomestic habitats. Within this context, special attention should be given to chicken coops and other close peridomestic structures in relation to the recolonization process of domestic habitats by T. infestans."
CANINE LEISHMANIASIS - PATHOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS INFLUENCING TRANSMISSION OF INFECTION,"Canine leishmaniasis was studied in 1,823 dogs from the Lisbon metropolitan region. The breeds most affected were doberman and German shepherd, independent of sex and use. Young adult (12.2%) and older dogs (14.7%) had higher prevalences of infection. Parasitological confirmation of serological diagnosis was higher in dogs with indirect fluorescent antibody test titer greater-than-or-equal-to 1:512, indicating that parasitological patency is a late event. Exposure of Leishmania in lymph nodes is more efficient for parasitological confirmation (75.4% of cases). Frequent signs of disease were enlarged lymph nodes and onychogriphosis. However, 53.8% of the dogs with significant antibody titers (greater-than-or-equal-to 1:128) showed no symptom, suggesting that canine leishmaniasis has a prolonged asymptomatic period. This study confirmed the importance of the dog as the reservoir of visceral leishmaniasis."
IDENTIFICATION OF CANINE VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS IN A PREVIOUSLY UNAFFECTED AREA BY CONVENTIONAL DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES AND CELL-BLOCK FIXATION,"After the report of a second case of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in Sao Bento da Lagoa, Itaipuacu, in the municipality of Marica, Rio de Janeiro State, an epidemiological survey was carried out, through active search, totaling 145 dogs. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and rapid chromatographic immunoassay based on dual-path platform (DPP (R)) were used to perform the serological examinations. The parasitological diagnosis of cutaneous fragments was performed by parasitological culture, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. In the serological assessment, 21 dogs were seropositive by IFA, 17 by ELISA, and 11 by DPP (R), with sensitivity of 66.7%, 66.7% and 50%, and specificity of 87.2%, 90.2% and 94%, respectively for each technique. The immunohistochemistry of bone marrow using the cell-block technique presented the best results, with six positive dogs found, three of which tested negative by the other parasitological techniques. Leishmania sp. was isolated by parasitological culture in three dogs. The detection of autochthonous Leishmania infantum in Itaipuacu, and the high prevalence of seropositive dogs confirm the circulation of this parasite in the study area and alert for the risk of expansion in the State of Rio de Janeiro."
"Environmental factors associated with canine visceral leishmaniasis in an area with recent introduction of the disease in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","The study assessed the association between environmental characteristics obtained by remote sensing and prevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in the neighborhood of Jacare, an area with recent introduction of the disease in the municipality (county) of Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. This was a cross-sectional study to assess CVL prevalence, defined as a positive result in the dual path platform (DPP) rapid immunochromatographic assay, confirmed by immunoenzymatic assay (IEA). The study included 97 dogs, with 21.6% CVL prevalence. CVL prevalence was higher in dogs with contact with another dog, opossum, marmoset, or hedgehog, as well as history of culling of other dogs with CVL from the household. In the multivariate analysis, adjusted for the dog's sex and age, dogs in areas with sparse vegetation showed fivefold higher prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection compared to dogs in areas with less vegetation (OR = 5.72; 95% CI: 1.47-22.20). Meanwhile, less urbanized areas, characterized as commercial or low-income residential areas, identified by remote sensing as those with high density of gray structures, were associated with lower CVL prevalence (OR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01-0.92). The higher prevalence of infection in dogs living alongside wild animals and in areas with more vegetation and lower prevalence in more urbanized areas suggest a rural transmission pattern for CVL in this area."
Trypanosome infections in cattle in farms of different departments in Cote d'Ivoire,"Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) remain one of the major constraints to the development of cattle breeding in sub-Saharan Africa. Parasitological and Entomological surveys of transversal nature were conducted in Cote d'Ivoire across 35 locations in 13 departments. Trypanosome infections in cattle, the abundance of tsetse flies and the correlation between trypanosome infections and abundance of tsetse flies in these localities were investigated. Thus, 1270 blood samples were taken at the auricular level and tsetse flies traps have been placed within the sites. The results revealed the presence of animal trypanosomiasis with 171 positive cattle with a prevalence of 13.5% in all sites. Three trypanosome species were identified with varying percentages: Trypanosoma vivax (82.5%), T. congolense (10.5%) and T. brucei (7%). At the entomological level, 2409 tsetse flies have been captured on all surveyed sites. The coefficient of correlation by Spearman gives the value r = 0.5 with a significance level p = 0. 07. On the threshold of 5%, there is no correlation between the prevalence of trypanosome infections and abundance of tsetse flies based on surveyed departments. These results show that the Savannah region is the most endemic AAT breeding area and for that reason, it will be chosen as a priority intervention area for control to the departments of Korhogo, Ferkessedougou, and Boundiali"
Hosts and vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units in the Chagas disease endemic region of the Paraguayan Chaco,"Active Trypanosoma cruzi transmission persists in the Gran Chaco region, which is considered hyperendemic for Chagas disease. Understanding domestic and sylvatic transmission cycles and therefore the relationship between vectors and mammalian hosts is crucial to designing and implementing improved effective control strategies. Here we describe the species of triatomine vectors and the sylvatic mammal reservoirs of T. cruzi, in different localities of the Paraguayan and Bolivian Chaco. We identify the T. cruzi genotypes discrete typing units (DTUs) and provide a map of their geographical distribution. A total of 1044 triatomines and 138 sylvatic mammals were captured. Five per cent of the triatomines were microscopically positive for T. cruzi (55 Triatoma infestans from Paraguay and one sylvatic Triatoma guasayana from Bolivia) and 17 animals (12.3%) comprising eight of 28 (28.5%) Dasypus novemcinctus, four of 27 (14.8%) Euphractus sexcinctus, three of 64 (4.7%) Chaetophractus spp. and two of 14 (14.3%) Didelphis albiventris. The most common DTU infecting domestic triatomine bugs was TcV (64%), followed by TcVI (28%), TcII (6.5%) and TcIII (1.5%). TcIII was overwhelmingly associated with armadillo species. We confirm the primary role of T. infestans in domestic transmission, armadillo species as the principal sylvatic hosts of TcIII, and consider the potential risk of TcIII as an agent of Chagas disease in the Chaco."
"Bovine trypanosomosis in the Upper West Region of Ghana: Entomological, parasitological and serological cross-sectional surveys","Baseline surveys were conducted in the Upper West Region of Ghana to assess the distribution and densities of tsetse species, as well as the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis. The entomological survey was designed to cover the suitable tsetse habitats along the three main rivers in the study area (i.e. Black Volta, Kulpawn and Sissili). Results indicated the presence of Glossina tachinoides in all three river basins, whilst Glossina palpalis gambiensis was only found close to the southern limit of the study area. A random sampling of 1800 cattle of the West African Short Horn, Sanga and Zebu breeds from 36 randomly selected grid cells covering the study area showed substantial differences between parasitological and serological prevalences. The average parasitological prevalence was estimated at 2.5% (95% CI: 1.06-5.77) with the majority of the infections due to Trypanosoma vivax. Most of the infected cattle were found close to the major river systems. The serological prevalence, measured using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), test was 19% (95% CI: 14.03-25.35). Cattle with anti-trypanosomal antibodies were also found throughout the study area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"The identification, diversity and prevalence of trypanosomes in field caught tsetse in Tanzania using ITS-1 primers and fluorescent fragment length barcoding","We report on the development of two generic, PCR-based methods, which replace the multiple species-specific PCR tests used previously to identify the trypanosome species carried by individual tsetse flies. The first method is based on interspecies size variation in the PCR product of the ITS-1 region of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) locus. In the second approach, length variation of multiple fragments within the 18S and 28S rRNA genes is assayed by PCR amplification with fluorescent primers; products are subsequently sized accurately and rapidly by the use of an automated DNA sequencer. Both methods were used to identify samples collected during large-scale field studies of trypanosome-infected tsetse in Tanzania in the National Parks of Tarangire and Serengeti, and the coastal forest reserve of Msubugwe. The fluctuations of trypanosome prevalence over time and two different field seasons are discussed. As well as facilitating the identification of trypanosome species with increased speed, precision and sensitivity, these generic systems have enabled us to identify two new species of trypanosome.

Estimation of Canine Leishmania Infection Prevalence in Six Cities of the Algerian Littoral Zone Using a Bayesian Approach,"A large-scale study on canine Leishmania infection (CanL) was conducted in six localities along a west-east transect in the Algerian littoral zone (Tlemcen, Mostaganem, Tipaza, Boumerdes, Bejaia, Jijel) and covering two sampling periods. In total 2,184 dogs were tested with an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and a direct agglutination test (DAT). Combined multiple-testing and several statistical methods were compared to estimate the CanL true prevalence and tests characteristics (sensitivity and specificity). The Bayesian full model showed the best fit and yielded prevalence estimates between 11% (Mostaganem, first period) and 38% (Bejaia, second period). Sensitivity of IFAT varied (in function of locality) between 86% and 88% while its specificity varied between 65% and 87%. DAT was less sensitive than IFAT but showed a higher specificity (between 80% and 95% in function of locality or/and season). A general increasing trend of the CanL prevalence was noted from west to east. A concordance between the present results and the incidence of human cases of visceral leishmaniasis was observed, where also a maximum was recorded for Bejaia. The results of the present study highlight the dangers when using IFAT as a gold standard."
Canine leishmaniasis in Algeria: True prevalence and diagnostic test characteristics in groups of dogs of different functional type,"A Bayesian approach was used to assess the prevalence of Canine leishmaniasis and evaluate three serological diagnostic tests: indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), direct agglutination test, and particle gel immuno-assay (PaGIA) for Canine leishmaniasis (CL) in Algiers. Four hundred and sixty-two dogs were involved in this study and divided in four groups according to their functional type: stray dogs, farm dogs, national guard dogs and pet dogs. The stray dog group showed the highest prevalence of leishmaniasis (11.7%), followed by the national guard dogs (9.7%) and the farm dogs (5.9%). IFAT was shown to be the most sensitive test in all groups. However. IFAT specificity was considerably lowered in the farm dog group: 65.2% versus 94.5% for the stray dogs. A considerable drop in PaGIA specificity was noted in the stray dogs group. The results of the current study demonstrate the variability of test characteristics in different situations and underline the danger of using standard values, without verifying their appropriateness for the specific purposes.

"Multiple-drug resistant Trypanosoma congolense populations in village cattle of Metekel district, north-west Ethiopia","Investigations were carried out to determine the prophylactic activity of isometamidium chloride in village populations of cattle naturally infected with trypanosomes in Metekel district, northwest Ethiopia. In a cross-sectional study in March 1997, 484 randomly selected cattle from four villages were examined for trypanosome infections by the dark ground/phase contrast buffy coat technique (BCT). The trypanosome prevalence was 17.2%. Trypanosoma congolense was the dominant species accounting for 47.6% of the overall infections. Fifty parasitaemic cattle from two villages were treated with isometainidium chloride (Trypamidium(R)) at a prophylactic dose of 1.0 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) and thereafter monitored on a monthly basis for parasitaemia. Trypanosomes were detected in six cattle within 1 month and in 18 cattle within 2 months of treatment. Twenty three percent (6/26) of cattle infected with T. congolense at the time of treatment were detected parasitaemic with this trypanosome species 1 month after treatment. Mice were infected with three T. congolense isolates obtained from cattle which were detected parasitaemic within one or 2 months after isometamidium treatment. The mice were subsequently treated with ranges of doses of isometamidium chloride or diminazene aceturate (Berenil(R)) and thereafter monitored for parasitaemia for a period of 60 days. Isometamidium chloride at doses of 0.5-4.0 mg/kg b.w. and diminazene aceturate at doses of 3.5-28.0 mg/kg b.w. failed to cure T. congolense infections in any of the animals. Three clones were derived from one of the isolates; each clone expressed high levels of resistance to both trypanocides when tested in mice. Based on these results it is concluded that the prophylactic activity of isometamidium is greatly reduced for some of the T. congolense populations present in the area, and in addition there is resistance to diminazene aceturate in this trypanosome species.

"Prevalence of infection by Leishmania spp. in a peri-urban area of Altagracia de Orituco, Guarico state, Venezuela","Leishmania infantum is the etiological agent of the visceral leishmaniasis (VL). However, in the Old World as well in the New World (Central America), this protozoan has also been involved in cases of atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL). Clinical, molecular and entomological evidences have demonstrated that a similar situation is happening in a peri-urban area of Altagracia de Orituco (Guarico state, Venezuela). With the purpose of contributing to the understanding of such an epidemiological scenario, a cross-sectional study was carryed out using the leishmanin skin test (LST) and screening for the seroprevalence to crude antigens of Leishmania spp. and rK39 by means of the ELISA test in cases of ACL reported in the period 1997-2000 (n = 8), among their co-inhabitants (n = 15) and in a randomly selected sample of 233 people. The dermoprevalence was 31.6% (67/212); 28.8% (67/233) were positive to the ELISA test using promastigotes of L. infantum (= L. chagasi) and 13.3% (31/233) had antibodies anti-L. braziliensis. In addition, the test of ELISA using the antigen rK39 was positive in one out of the eight cases studied and in two out of their co-inhabitants; as well as in 13.7% (32/233) of the inhabitants of the community. The results obtained in this epidemiological study indicate the circulation of species of the sub-genus Leishmania as well as of the subgenus Viannia. The presence of antibodies antiLeishmania in general was associated to the age and the time of residence in the zone."
"Parasite populations of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) in the Rivers Ulla and Tea (Galicia, northwest Spain)","A two-year study was performed of the parasite fauna of the European eel in two rivers, the Ulla and the Tea, in the region of Galicia in northwest Spain, with monthly sampling. A total of 523 eels were captured, and a total of 20 parasite species identified: 7 protozoa (Trypanosoma granulosum, Eimeria anguillae, Myxidium giardi, Myxobolus portucalensis, Hofferellus gilsoni, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and Trichodina jadranica), 12 helminths (Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae, Pseudodactylogyrus bini, Nicolla gallica, Diplostomum sp., Bothriocephalus claviceps, Paraquimperia tenerrima, Spinitectus inermis, Cucullanus heterochrous, Pseudocapillaria tomentosa, Anisakis simplex L-3 larvae, Anguillicola crassus, and Acanthocephalus clavula) and a copepod (Ergasilus gibbus). This is the first report for M. portucalensis, T jadranica, and R tomentosa from Spain, and for N. gallica from the Iberian Peninsula. Statistically significant differences in prevalence were observed between the two rivers only in the cases of T granulosum, T jadranica, Diplostomum sp. and C heterochrous. The presence of some species was positively correlated with host body length. Some species pairs showed positive or negative mutual correlations of presence, but only for the pair T granulosum-Pseudodactylogyrus spp. were there statistically significant correlations in both rivers.

Low Seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum and Toxoplasma gondii in the Horse Population in Israel,"A cross-sectional investigation was done on the seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum and Toxoplasma gondii infection among apparently healthy horses in Israel. This survey included 383 horses distributed in 22 farms throughout Israel during the years 2011-2013. Serum samples were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using the direct agglutination test (DAT) specific to Leishmania and by the modified agglutination test (MAT) for the presence of IgG antibodies to T. gondii. Low seroprevalences were detected for both L. infantum and T. gondii in the horse population in Israel; of the 338 horses tested, 6 (1.4%) were found to be seropositive for L. infantum and 11 (2.5%) for T. gondii, with no significant association between seroprevalence and demographic/environmental factors. An ongoing geographical expansion of L. infantum, previously reported in humans and dogs in Israel, was also supported by our results in horses. Here we present evidence of exposure of horses to L. infantum and T. gondii in Israel. Continuous seroprevalence surveillance in horses, such as the one performed in this study, might further elucidate the eco-epidemiology of these two important zoonotic parasites in this country."
An atlas of tsetse and bovine trypanosomosis in Sudan,"Background: After a long period of neglect, initiatives are being implemented in Sudan to control tsetse and trypanosomosis. Their planning, execution and monitoring require reliable information on the geographic distribution of the disease and its vectors. However, geo-referenced and harmonized data at the national level are lacking, despite the fact that a number of epidemiological studies were conducted over the years. The Atlas of tsetse and bovine trypanosomosis in Sudan tries to fill this gap. Methods: The present study includes both a review of historical datasets on tsetse flies and bovine trypanosomosis, as well as the results of recent, targeted field investigations. The review includes both published and unpublished datasets collected in Sudan from 1960 onwards. Targeted field investigations were conducted for trypanosomosis in Blue Nile (2011) and Gezeira States (2012), for tsetse flies in South Darfur (2012) and Blue Nile States (2009 and 2011), and for other trypanosomosis vectors in seven States (Khartoum, Gezeira, White Nile, Blue Nile, North Kordofan, Kassala and Gadarif). The latter surveys, conducted from 2010 to 2012, also enabled us to confirm the absence of tsetse flies in a number of locations. Results: Tsetse fly infestation in Sudan appears to be limited to two relatively small areas at the south-western and south-eastern tips of the Country (South Darfur and Blue Nile State respectively). Glossina morsitans submorsitans is present in both areas, whilst G. fuscipes fuscipes is found only in the latter. In contrast, bovine trypanosomosis is widespread, its presence having being confirmed in eleven States and suspected in all the others. Both mechanical transmission by non-cyclical vectors and animal movement contribute to this broad distribution of trypanosomosis. This is especially the case for Trypanosoma vivax, which was found even in sedentary cattle at hundreds of kilometres of the tsetse belt. Conclusions: The Atlas provides a spatially-explicit synthesis of the current knowledge of tsetse and bovine trypanosomosis in Sudan. Its various epidemiological outputs are being used to target both trypanosomosis control activities and further data collection exercises. Activities are ongoing to expand the Atlas to non-cyclical vectors and hosts other than cattle."
Blood parasites of some Anurans from southern Nigeria,"Eighty nine wild anurans comprising of 14 species from nine genera i.e. Afixalus dorsalis, Amietophrynus maculatus, A. regularis, Amnirana galamensis, Arthroleptis poecilonotus, Arthroleptis sp., Aubria subsigilata, Hoplobatrachus occipitalis, Hyperolus concolor, Hyperolus fusciventris, Hyperolus fusciventris burfoni, Hyperolus sp., Ptychadena mascareniensis and Silurana tropicalis caught from three sampling sites: Okomu Oil Palm Plantation, Usen Cocoa Plantation and the banks of River Niger at Agenegbode, Edo State in southern Nigeria were examined for blood parasites. Nine anuran individuals (10.11%) were parasitaemic. Four species of blood parasites; microfilariae of Folleyellides, microfilariae of an unidentified filarid nematode, a Trypanosoma sp. and an intracellular blood parasite, were identified in the infected anurans. Of the four blood parasite species encountered, the microfilariae of Folleyellides was the most prevalent 7/89 (7.87%), occurring in 2 individuals of Hoplobatrachus occipitalis from Okomu and in 4 individuals of Amietophrynus spp.; in 3 individuals of A. regularis from Agenegbode and in 1 individual of A. maculatus from Usen and in 1 individual of A. galamensis from Agenegbode. It was followed by the Trypanosoma sp. with a prevalence rate of 3.37%, occurring in 1 individual of Amietophrynus maculatus from Usen and in 2 individuals of Amietophrynus regularis from Agenegbode. Folleyellides microfilariae seem to be a multi-host parasite occurring in four host species in contrast to the unidentified filarid detected only in Aubria subsigillata. The unidentified intracellular blood parasite bears close resemblance to Hemoliva sp. and was only detected in A. regularis from Agenegbode. With regards to sex, more females harboured blood parasites with a prevalence of 25% in contrast to males which had only 1.75%."
"Phlebotomus sergenti in a Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Focus in Azilal Province (High Atlas, Morocco): Molecular Detection and Genotyping of Leishmania tropica, and Feeding Behavior","Background Phlebotomus (Paraphlebotomus) sergenti is at least one of the confirmed vectors for the transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania tropica and distributed widely in Morocco. This form of leishmaniasis is considered largely as anthroponotic, although dogs were found infected with Leishmania tropica, suggestive of zoonosis in some rural areas. Methodology and Findings This survey aimed at (i) studying the presence of Leishmania in field caught Phlebotomus sergenti, (ii) investigating genetic diversity within Leishmania tropica and (iii) identifying the host-blood feeding preferences of Phlebotomus sergenti. A total of 4,407 sand flies were collected in three rural areas of Azilal province, using CDC miniature light traps. Samples collected were found to consist of 13 species: Phlebotomus spp. and 3 Sergentomyia spp. The most abundant species was Phlebotomus sergenti, accounting for 45.75% of the total. 965 female Phlebotomus sergenti were screened for the presence of Leishmania by ITS1-PCR-RFLP, giving a positive rate of 5.7%(55/965), all being identified as Leishmania tropica. Nucleotide heterogeneity of PCR-amplified ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene-ITS2 was noted. Analyses of 31 sequences obtained segregated them into 16 haplotypes, of which 7 contain superimposed peaks at certain nucleotide positions, suggestive of heterozygosity. Phlebotomus sergenti collected were found to feed on a large variety of vertebrate hosts, as determined by Cytochrome b sequencing of the DNA from the blood meals of 64 engorged females. Conclusion Our findings supported the notion that Phlebotomus sergenti is the primary vector of Leishmania tropica in this focus, and that the latter is genetically very heterogeneous. Furthermore, our results might be suggestive of a certain level of heterozygosity in Leishmania tropica population. This finding, as well as the feeding of the vectors on different animals are of interest for further investigation."
Molecular Epizootiology of Rodent Leishmaniasis in a Hyperendemic Area of Iran,"Background: Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) is an expanding disease and public health problem in Iran. In the current study, natural Leishmania infection rate and seasonal fluctuation of the infection in Rhombomys opimus population of a hyperendemic focus of ZCL in Iran was investigated. Methods: The study was conducted from October 2006 to October 2008 in Esfahan Province, central part of Iran. An extensive sampling of rodents using Sherman traps was done in different seasons. Nested PCR assay was used for detection and identification of Leishmania species and the results were confirmed using PCR-RFLP. Results: Leishmania infection rate was 58.6% (34 of 58) using nested PCR. 44.8% of the gerbils were infected only with L. turanica and 1.7% with L. gerbilli alone. A mixed natural infection with L. major and L. turanica was seen in 12.1% of the rodents. L. major infection alone was not seen in R. opimus population in the study area. The highest and lowest Leishmania infection rates were observed in fall and spring respectively. L. turanica infection was observed throughout the year whereas mixed infections with L. major and L. turanica was not seen in spring. Conclusion: It is concluded that in the study area, L. major, L. gerbilli and L. turanica circulate in the population of R. opimus. Leishmania major infection usually accompanied by L. turanica in naturally infected gerbils with the highest rate in fall. It is recommended that the role of L. turanica in the epidemiology and transmission of ZCL be revisited."
Molecular Characterization of Leishmania Infection from Naturally Infected Sand Flies Caught in a Focus of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (Eastern Iran),"Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania major is a serious and increasing problem affecting many rural areas of 17 out of 31 provinces in Iran. Little is known about sand fly fauna and leishmaniases in Eastern Iran and no study has been carried out in Sarbisheh County. The aim of this study was to determine sand flies composition and probable Leishmania infection to find the probable vectors of leishmaniasis in Sarbisheh district. Methods: Sand flies were caught using both sticky papers and CDC light traps in August 2010. They were identified morphologically and analyzed for Leishmania infection by amplification of ITS-rDNA. Results: Totally, 842 specimens were caught and 8 species recorded. They belonged to the genera Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia: P. (Phlebotomus) papatasi, P. (Paraphlebotomus) sergenti, P. (Pa.) caucasicus, P. (Pa.) mongolensis, P. (Pa.) jacusieli, S. (Sergentomyia) dentata, S. (Se.) sintoni and S. (Sintonius) clydei. All collected females were processed for Leishmania DNA detection by PCR amplifying of Internal Transcribed Spacer1 (partial sequence), 5.8S (complete sequence) and ITS2 (partial sequence) fragments. Thirteen females were positive for Leishmania DNA. The sequencing of the 430 bp amplicons indicated that 9 P. papatasi and 3 females belonging to the Caucasicus group carried L. major DNA whereas one P. sergenti carried L. tropica DNA. Conclusion: Phlebotomus papatasi and P. sergenti are, like in several places, the probable vectors of cutaneous leishmaniases in this emerging or unknown focus of cutaneous leishmaniases."
Molecular characterization of Leishmania spp. in reservoir hosts in endemic foci of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in Iran,"Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) is an expanding disease and a public health issue in Iran. In the present study, rate of natural infection of rodent populations with Leishmania was investigated in six endemic foci including 28 villages in Golestan, Esfahan, Yazd, Fars, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces. A total of 593 rodents were captured and identified as Rhombomys opimus (n = 325), Meriones libycus (n = 171), Meriones persicus (n = 27), Tatera indica (n = 37), Nesokia indica (n = 12), Rattus rattus (n = 13) and Mus musculus (n = 8). Microscopic examinations of Giemsa-stained smears showed that 108 out of 593 (18.2%) rodents were infected with Leishmania spp., whereas infection of 186 out of 593 (31.4%) rodents with Leishmania was then confirmed by ITS1-PCR. The highest rate of infection was found in R. opimus (prevalence of 35%) and M libycus (31%). Based on Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), 145 (78%) of 186 samples detected as Leishmania DNA were identified as L. major, 8 (4%) samples as L. turanica and 33 (18%) as mixed infection (L. major and L. turanica). Samples from infected rodents were inoculated subcutaneously at tail base of BALB/c mice. In 35 of them, nodules and ulcers containing amastigotes appeared at the inoculation site. The samples prepared from infected rodents were cultured in NNN medium and only two samples were positive. Rhombomys opimus, M libycus, M persicus, T indica and N. indica were confirmed as reservoir hosts of ZCL in the studied regions. Leishmania major infection was usually accompanied L. turanica in naturally infected gerbils (R. opimus and M libycus) in Golestan, Esfahan and Fars provinces."
"Feline visceral leishmaniasis in Kerman, southeast of Iran: Serological and molecular study","Background & objectives: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a fatal zoonotic disease in tropical and sub-tropical countries including Iran. Dogs constitute the main domestic reservoir for VL (kala-azar) in Iran but incidence of the disease in cats from Fars and East Azerbaijan provinces has led to propose them as secondary reservoirs, and possible expansion of the feline role in the transmission of disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in stray cats in Kerman City by ELISA and PCR methods. Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 60 stray cats were randomly live trapped from different parts of Kerman City during a six month period between March and September 2014. About 3 ml blood samples were drawn from jugular vein of captured cats and a detailed questionnaire about demographic characteristics and clinical status of each cat was recorded by attending veterinarian. The complete blood counts and biochemistry analysis were performed for all cats. Finally collected sera samples were tested by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit and PCR amplification method. Results: Prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection was 6.7 and 16.7% by ELISA and PCR assays, respectively. Infection rate was significantly higher in leukopenic cats, which were older than 3 yr. Interpretation & conclusion: The results of the study indicate that stray cats are at risk of L. infantum infection in Kerman City. Further, studies are required to elucidate the role of cats as potential reservoir host in the epidemiology of VL in endemic regions."
"Prevalence and Intensity of Blood Parasites in Wild Pigeons and Doves (Family: Columbidae) from Shasha Forest Reserve, Ile-Ife, Nigeria","A total of 248 wild pigeons and doves representing seven species, mist-netted between March 2006 and February 2007, were examined for parasitemia using thin blood smears. Seventy-seven individuals (31.0%) harboured blood parasites, The identified blood parasites included Haemoproteus (6.5% prevalence); Plasmodium (12.1 %), Trypanosoma (6.9%), Microfilariae (6.0%) and Leucocytozoon (2.0%). The highest prevalences of Haemoproteus (11.6%), Plasmodium (28.57%), Trypanosoma (21,43%), Microfilariae (50.0%) and Leucocytozoon (10.0%) were found in Laughing Dove Streptopelia senegalensis, Red-eyed Dove Streptopelia semitorquata, Bronze-naped Pigeon Columba malherbii, Grey wood pigeon columba unicincta and Green Fruit Pigeon Treron australis, respectively. The lowest prevalences for the blood parasites were found in Tambourine Dove Turtur tympanistria (3.45% for Haemoproteus), Columba unicincta (4.55% for Plasmodium), Turtur tympanistria (1.72% each for Trypanosoma and Microfilariae) and Streptopelia semitorquata (7.14% for Leucocytozoon). The highest intensifies of infection. in terms of mean parasitemias were found in Streptopelia senegalensis (11.6 +/- 4.73 Haemoproleus), Turtur tympanistria (9.31 +/- 3.57 Plasmodium), Streptopelia semitorquata (13.5 +/- 7.11 Trypanosoma), Columba unicincta (20.4 +/- 8.16 microfilariae) and Treron australis (3.44 +/- 0.65 Leucocytozoon). The Blue-headed Dove Turtur brehmeri was the only species without any obvious parasitemia."
Molecular and Serological Evidence of Leishmania Infection in Stray Dogs from Visceral Leishmaniasis-Endemic Areas of Bangladesh,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), or kala-azar, is mainly caused by two closely related Leishmania species, Leishmania infanturn and Leishmania donovani. Leishmania infantum is responsible for zoonotic VL, with dogs as the main reservoir host in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Asia, and South America. In the Indian subcontinent, VL is caused by L. donovani and is considered anthroponotic, although the only known vector, the sand fly, is zoophilic in nature. The role of domestic and stray dogs in VL transmission is still unclear in this area. We screened 50 stray dogs from VL-endemic areas of Bangladesh for serological and molecular evidence of Leishmania infection. We detected anti-Leishmania antibodies in six (12%) dog serum samples using rK39 immunochromatographic tests. We observed Leishmania kinetoplast DNA in 10 (20%) buffy coat DNA samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), five of which were positive based on internal transcribed spacer 1-PCR. A sequencing analysis of the amplified products confirmed that the parasitic DNA was derived from L. donovani. Our findings support the hypothesis that stray dogs are an animal reservoir for L. donovani in this endemic region. Further studies are required to determine the precise role of dogs in the epidemiology of VL in Bangladesh."
Potential of cell-free DNA as a screening marker for parasite infections in dog,"Parasitic infections are common in stray dogs and accurate knowledge of parasite communities in dogs would provide insight into the epidemiology of parasitic diseases. In this study, we used Illumina sequencing technology to evaluate cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a marker for screening of parasitic infections in dogs. Plasma samples from 14 stray dogs captured in Bangladesh were used in the experiments. An average of 2.3 million reads was obtained for each sample. BLASTn analysis identified 150 reads with high similarity with parasites from 19 different genera. In particular, we detected sequences of Babesia spp. in five dogs; consistent with this, a previous study using conventional PCR showed that four of these dogs were positive for B. gibsoni. Several reads with similarity to Leishmania and filarial nematodes were also identified. These findings indicate that cfDNA in blood can be a potential screening marker for identifying parasite diversity in dogs."
"Phylogenetic analysis of sandflies populations using cytochrome b (mtCytb) gene and identification of Leishmania DNA within infected Sandflies, from the city of Najaf, Iraq","Objectives Sandflies are the major public health concern in various part of the world. The aim of this study is to identity the species strain of sandflies, using molecular methods. Methods Sandflies were collected from January to October 2017, in 16 rural areas in the province of Najaf AL-Ashraf, Iraq. Polymerase chain reaction technique was performed for detection of mitochondria' cytochrome b (rntCytb) gene in Phlebotomus papatasi (P. papatasi), Phlebotomus sergenti (P. sergergi), and Sergentomyia sintoni (S. sintoni). DNA sequencing method was performed for confirmatory identification of P. papatasi, P. sergenti and S. sintoni from local isolates based on mtCytb, using phylogenetic tree analysis (MEGA.6) and NCBI-BLAST multiple sequence alignment tool. Results Morphological identification of sandflies shows that all specimens were categorized into two genera with three species, Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia. Leishmania DNA was detected in 16 pools, all were infected with Leishmania major, eight of them infected with Leishmania tropico. Sequencing and phylogenetic inference analysis confirmed that the local P. papatasi isolates were demonstrated to be closely related to the NCBI, P. papatasi reference sequence (AF161214.1), the local P. sergenti isolates showed high similarity with the NCBI, P. sergenti sequence (AF161216.1), and the local S. sintoni isolates showed high homology with the NCBI, S. sintoni sequence (EU159507.1). Conclusions P. papatasi, P. sergenti and S. sintoni were the genotypes that has a high prevalence in the city of Najaf. No previous data were found in this regard. The present study contributes to a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of this parasite."
"Parasitological survey of visceral leishmaniasis (Kala-azar) in Al-diwaniyah province, iraq",no access
The distribution of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Iraq: demographic and climate aspects,"Background: Leishmaniasis is endemic in Iraq, where both cutaneous and visceral forms of the disease are reported. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and to identify associations of CL with age, sex, season, and provinces depending on some demographic and climatic aspects. Methods: This study is retrospective and includes reported cases of infections using the available surveillance database taken from the Iraqi Ministry of Health for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 for all provinces of Iraq. Results: Men and boys were found to be at higher risk for CL compared with women and girls. The majority of cases were recorded among those in age groups 5-14 and 15-45 years old. Most cases were recorded from lowland provinces with moderate annual rainfalls and a high rural population. Conclusions: This study provides initial necessary data for public health specialists working to assess management approaches for the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Iraq."
"PARASITOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR DETECTION OF CANINE TRYPANOSOMIASIS FROM RIYADH PROVINCE, SAUDI ARABIA","Trypanosoma evansi is the most widespread of the pathogenic salivarian trypanosomes; it causes a serious disease called surra that affects domestic animals such as camels, horses, and dogs, and often leads to reduced productivity and economic losses. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence rates of trypanosomiasis using 3 parasitological tests (wet blood film, Giemsa staining, and microhematocrit centrifugation technique) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) among stray dogs from Riyadh Province, Saudi Arabia. In the current study, 117 dog blood samples collected from certain districts of Riyadh Province showed that 5 of 117 dogs (4.3%) were positive for the genus Trypanosoma. In addition, the findings indicated no effect of dog gender or age on parasite infection. For a more specific diagnosis, PCR amplification of the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene in 5 internal transcribed spacer 1 -positive samples diagnosed with Trypanosoma indicated that 2 were positive for RoTat 1.2 T. evansi. The absence of the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene in 3 of the 5 T. evansi-positive samples could be explained by the circulation of T. evansi type B in dogs from Saudi Arabia. Thus, this is the first study demonstrating T. evansi type B outside of Africa."
Molecular Detection of Leishmania spp. in Skin and Blood of Stray Dogs from Endemic Areas of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Saudi Arabia,"Background: Dogs can act as reservoirs of canine leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania species. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of canine leishmaniasis using a PCR technique among stray dogs living in three provinces of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, Al-Ahsa Oasis and Al-Qaseem, where the disease is endemic; and to identify and document different Leishmania to species levels Methods: This cross-sectional investigation was conducted, from Mar 2016 to Apr 2018, in three parts of Saudi Arabia: Central province (Riyadh), Eastern province (Al-Ahsa Oasis) and Al-Qaseem province. Blood samples were collected from 526 dogs; 40 presented cutaneous nodules so were suspected clinically of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Biopsy tissue collections and parasite cultures were performed. A generic kDNA was performed using different primers for Leishmania differentiation. Results: All blood samples were negative for Leishmania infantum infection by molecular analysis, though forty dogs had thick cutaneous lesions in different parts of their body. Four dogs' skin lesions were associated with dermatitis, splenomegaly and lymphadenomegaly. Parasite culture was used to diagnose cutaneous leishmaniasis, identifying 31/40 (77.5%) positive samples. Overall, of 526 samples, the prevalence of L. major and L. tropica was found to be 4% and 1.9%, respectively. Gender and age had a significant effect on Leishmania prevalence: (P=0.0212 and 0.0357), respectively. Conclusion: This was the first molecular study of dog leishmaniasis from Saudi Arabia of dogs confirmed to have cutaneous leishmaniasis. Further epidemiological and molecular investigations of domestic and wild canine infections with L. major, L. tropica and L. infantum in endemic and nonendemic areas of Saudi Arabia are required, for leishmaniasis control."
Molecular detection of equine trypanosomiasis in the Riyadh Province of Saudi Arabia,"We conducted a cross-sectional study to detect trypanosome infections of horses and donkeys in the Riyadh Province of Saudi Arabia. DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from 368 horses and 142 donkeys, and subjected to universal first ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1)-PCR followed by Trypanosoma evansi species-specific RoTat1.2-PCR. The universal ITS1-PCR revealed T. evansi infection in horses (n = 12; 3.3%) and donkeys (n = 4; 2.8%). There was no significant effect of sex or age on the prevalence of trypanosomiasis in horses or donkeys. Application of the RoTat1.2-PCR revealed that the RoTat1.2 VSG gene was absent from the positive ITS1-PCR samples of 3 horses and 1 donkey. This discrepancy could be explained by the circulation of T. evansi type B in Saudi Arabia; however, this suspicion requires confirmation."
Molecular detection of Trypanosoma evansi in camels (Camelus dromedarius) in southwestern Saudi Arabia,"This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection and its associated risk factors in camels in the Jazan region, southwestern Saudi Arabia. A total of 679 blood samples were collected from three local breeds of camel - Awadia, Awarkia and Sawahelle - in 11 randomly selected governorates of Jazan region. Blood samples were screened by Giemsa-stained blood film (GSBF) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The overall prevalence of T. evansi was 30.9% (210/679, CI: 27.6-34.5%) by PCR, whereas a prevalence of 22.2% (151/679, CI: 19.3-25.5%) was revealed by GSBF. The highest prevalence was identified in Ad-Darb (55.6%) followed by Farasan (44.4%) and Alarda (42.1%) while the lowest prevalence was found in Samtah (10.6%). A significant association between the infection and the location of the camels was found (P = 0.023); a high infection rate was recorded in the northern governorates which declined gradually in the central and southern governorates, regardless of the sex, breed or age of the camels. Moreover, a significant interaction of breed and age on disease prevalence was found (P = 0.012). Camels of the Awadia breed aged below 5 years were 3.6 times more likely to harbour T. evansi than those of the Awarkia breed aged over 15 years. This study demonstrates that T. evansi infection is prevalent among camels in southwestern Saudi Arabia. Further studies should be conducted to focus on vectors and hosts, and to evaluate the potential risk factors in order to plan and implement effective control programmes."
Revisiting leishmaniasis in the time of war: the Syrian conflict and the Lebanese outbreak,"Background: Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in many worldwide foci including the Middle East. Several outbreaks have occurred in the Middle East over the past decades, mostly related to war-associated population migration. With the start of the Syrian war, the frequency and magnitude of these outbreaks increased alarmingly. We describe the epidemiology of Leishmania infection in Lebanon and the most recent outbreak relevant to the Syrian war. Methods: We reviewed all leishmaniasis cases reported to the Epidemiologic Surveillance Department at the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health between 2001 and the first quarter of 2014. The demographics and distribution of Syrian refugees in Lebanon were linked to reports of new Leishmania cases. Results: In total, 1033 new cases of leishmaniasis were reported in 2013 compared to a previous annual number in the range of 0-6 cases. The majority of cases reported in 2013 involved Syrian refugees and their relevant areas of concentration. Conclusions: This new outbreak of leishmaniasis in Lebanon is the first of its kind for more than a decade. The sudden increase in Leishmania cases in Lebanon in 2013 is attributed to the increasing numbers and wide distribution of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. This serves as an example of the risks associated with military conflicts and the ability of communicable diseases to cross borders. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Evaluation of four molecular methods to detect Leishmania infection in dogs,"Background: Canine leishmaniasis, a zoonotic disease caused by Leishmania infantum vectored by phlebotomine sand flies, is considered a relevant veterinary and public health problem in various countries, namely in the Mediterranean basin and Brazil, where dogs are considered the main reservoir hosts. Not only diseased dogs but also those subclinically infected play a relevant role in the transmission of L. infantum to vectors; therefore, early diagnosis is essential, under both a clinical and an epidemiological perspective. Molecular tools can be a more accurate and sensitive approach for diagnosis, with a wide range of protocols currently in use. The aim of the present report was to compare four PCR based protocols for the diagnosis of canine Leishmania infection in a cohort of dogs from the Douro region, Portugal. Results: A total of 229 bone marrow samples were collected from dogs living in the Douro region, an endemic region for leishmaniasis. Four PCR protocols were evaluated for Leishmania DNA detection in canine samples, three single (ITS1-PCR, MC-PCR and Uni21/Lmj4-PCR) and one nested (nested SSU rRNA-PCR). Two of the protocols were based on nuclear targets and the other two on kinetoplastid targets. The higher overall percentage of infected dogs was detected with the nested SSU rRNA-PCR (37.6%), which also was able to detect Leishmania DNA in a higher number of samples from apparently healthy dogs (25.3%). The ITS1-PCR presented the lowest level of Leishmania detection. Conclusions: Nested SSU rRNA-PCR is an appropriate method to detect Leishmania infection in dogs. Accurate and early diagnosis in clinically suspect as well as apparently healthy dogs is essential, in order to treat and protect animals and public health and contribute to the control and awareness of the disease."
"The Prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the Causal Agent of Chagas Disease, in Texas Rodent Populations","Rodent species were assessed as potential hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, from five sites throughout Texas in sylvan and disturbed habitats. A total of 592 rodents were captured, resulting in a wide taxonomic representation of 11 genera and 15 species. Heart samples of 543 individuals were successfully analyzed by SybrGreen-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting a 166 bp fragment of satellite DNA of T. cruzi. Eight rodents representing six species from six genera and two families were infected with T. cruzi. This is the first report of T. cruzi in the pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori) and the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) for the USA. All infected rodents were from the southernmost site (Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area). No differences in pathogen prevalence existed between disturbed habitats (5 of 131 tested; 3.8%) and sylvan habitats (3 of 40 tested; 7.5%). Most positives (n = 6, 16% prevalence) were detected in late winter with single positives in both spring (3% prevalence) and fall (1% prevalence). Additionally, 30 Triatoma insects were collected opportunistically from sites in central Texas. Fifty percent of these insects, i.e., 13 T. gerstaeckeri (68%), and two T. lecticularia (100%) were positive for T. cruzi. Comparative sequence analyses of 18S rRNA of samples provided identical results with respect to detection of the presence or absence of T. cruzi and assigned T. cruzi from rodents collected in late winter to lineage TcI. T. cruzi from Triatoma sp. and rodents from subsequent collections in spring and fall were different, however, and could not be assigned to other lineages with certainty."
The use of enzyme linked immunosorbent assays to investigate the prevalence of Trypanosoma equiperdum in Ethiopian horses,"A field study involving 309 horses was undertaken in the provinces of Arsi and Bale in the Ethiopian highlands to investigate the prevalence of Trypanosoma equiperdum infections using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of both trypanosomal antigen and antibody. Adult horses of both sexes were examined for clinical signs of T. equiperdum infection and serum samples were collected for the assays. One hundred and one horses showed the presence of trypanosomal antibodies in their serum and 70 animals showed typical clinical signs of dourine. Nineteen horses showed the presence of trypanosomal antigen. Eight horses were positive for both T. equiperdum antibody and antigen. Blood and genital washes from seven antigenaemic horses were inoculated into mice and rabbits in an attempt to isolate trypanosomes but none became infected. Statistical analysis of the results of the antibody assays indicated that there were significant differences in the distribution of serologically positive horses in the different clinical groupings, with seroprevalence increasing with the severity of the observed clinical signs (P < 0.001). There was also a positive correlation between the presence of circulating trypanosomal antigen and clinical evidence of infection, Although it was not possible to obtain direct parasitological evidence of infection, the results of the serological assays, together with the clinical signs of disease observed in many of the horses, provide strong circumstantial evidence that T. equiperdum occurs in Arsi and Bale provinces of Ethiopia. Furthermore, in view of the large number of horses in Ethiopia and the unrestricted movement of animals throughout the country it is likely that dourine may be more widespread in Ethiopia than is currently realised. The assays used show potential for diagnosis of dourine, but to be widely applied in field situations for the diagnosis and control of dourine in Africa they require further validation of their specificity and sensitivity.

Seroprevalence of vector-borne pathogens and molecular detection of Borrelia afzelii in military dogs from Portugal,"Background: Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are increasingly being reported worldwide and represent a serious threat to both animal and public health. Military dogs may constitute a risk group for the agents causing these diseases, as they frequently work outdoors in different areas and are thus exposed to vector arthropods. In order to assess the risk of exposure of this type of dogs, a serological and molecular survey was conducted in military working dogs in Portugal. One hundred apparently healthy dogs were surveyed. Serum samples were tested for antigens of Angiostrongylus vasorum and Dirofilaria immitis; and for antibodies to A. vasorum, Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Ehrlichia canis, Leishmania infantum, Rickettsia spp. and Toscana virus. Serum was tested by polymerase chain reaction for Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), with sequencing of the DNA products. Results: Forty-nine per cent of the dogs were seropositive for antibodies against Rickettsia spp., 16 % for Anaplasma spp., 13 % for L. infantum, 7 % for E. canis, 5 % for A. vasorum (including 1 % positive for both antibodies and circulating antigens), 3 % for Babesia spp. and 1 % positive for Toscana virus. B. burgdorferi (s.l.) was detected in eight out of 94 dogs tested (8.5 %) and in three cases (3.2 %) nucleotide sequence analysis showed identity with the genospecies Borrelia afzelii. No positive cases were recorded for D. immitis. Overall, 66 % of the dogs were positive for at least one out of the eight tested CVBD agents, six of which are zoonotic (i.e. Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., E. canis, L. infantum, Rickettsia spp. and Toscana virus). Serological specific antibody detection against more than one CVBD agent (including molecular detection of Borrelia spp.) was recorded in 25 % of the dogs, comprising 19 % with positive reaction to two agents, 5 % to three agents and 1 % to four agents. Conclusions: These results reveal a high occurrence of CVBD agents in military working dogs in Portugal and highlight the need to maintain a comprehensive and regular prophylaxis to reduce the contact between working dogs and those pathogens. For the first time in Portugal, B. afzelii DNA was identified in dogs and a dog was found seropositive for antibodies against Toscana virus."
Epidemiology of blood parasitic infections in the urban rat population in peninsular Malaysia,"A total of 719 wild rats were captured from four localities representing the west (Kuala Lumpur), east (Kuantan), north (Georgetown) and south (Malacca) to determine the diversity of blood protozoan from the urban wild rat population in peninsular Malaysia. Five rat species were recovered with Rattus rattus diardii being the most dominant species, followed by Rattus norvegicus, Rattus exulans, Rattus annandalei and Rattus argentiventer. Two blood protozoan species were found infecting the rodent population namely, Plasmodium sp. (42.1%) and Trypanosoma lewisi (25.0%). This study reports the presence of Plasmodium sp. for the first time in the rodent population in Malaysia. Two main intrinsic factors were identified affecting the parasitic infections. Trypanosoma lewisi infections were influenced by host age and sex with infections observed higher in male and juvenile rats meanwhile Plasmodium sp. infections were observed almost similar in both sexes. However, infections were higher in sub-adult rats."
"Molecular eco-epidemiology of Triatoma brasiliensis, the most important Chagas disease vector in Brazil: detection of vector foci highly infected by Trypanosoma cruzi and associated with the reservoir Kerodon rupestris (Rodentia: Caviidae)",no access
"Molecular Individual-Based Approach on Triatoma brasiliensis: Inferences on Triatomine Foci, Trypanosoma cruzi Natural Infection Prevalence, Parasite Diversity and Feeding Sources","We used an individual-based molecular multisource approach to assess the epidemiological importance of Triatoma brasiliensis collected in distinct sites and ecotopes in Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil. In the semi-arid zones of Brazil, this blood sucking bug is the most important vector of Trypanosoma cruzi-the parasite that causes Chagas disease. First, cytochrome b (cytb) and microsatellite markers were used for inferences on the genetic structure of five populations (108 bugs). Second, we determined the natural T. cruzi infection prevalence and parasite diversity in 126 bugs by amplifying a mini-exon gene from triatomine gut contents. Third, we identified the natural feeding sources of 60 T. brasiliensis by using the blood meal content via vertebrate cytb analysis. Demographic inferences based on cytb variation indicated expansion events in some sylvatic and domiciliary populations. Microsatellite results indicated gene flow between sylvatic and anthropic (domiciliary and peridomiciliary) populations, which threatens vector control efforts because sylvatic population are uncontrollable. A high natural T. cruzi infection prevalence (52-71%) and two parasite lineages were found for the sylvatic foci, in which 68% of bugs had fed on Kerodon rupestris (Rodentia: Caviidae), highlighting it as a potential reservoir. For peridomiciliary bugs, Galea spixii (Rodentia: Caviidae) was the main mammal feeding source, which may reinforce previous concerns about the potential of this animal to link the sylvatic and domiciliary T. cruzi cycles."
Geographical Variation and Factors Associated to Seroprevalence of Canine Leishmaniosis in an Endemic Mediterranean Area,"P>This article retrospectively analyses the spatial distribution and dog- and environmental-level risk factors associated to Leishmania infantum seroprevalence among 807 asymptomatic dogs in the Municipality of Crevillente in Alicante in southeast Spain in 1999. They represented 60% of the dogs in this 103 km2 area, with a human census of 27 034 people and 90% lived in Crevillente town. The estimated seroprevalence (95% confidence interval) in 714 dogs >= 1-year old was 22% (19-25) however; it was 12% (8-15) in town dogs and 0-100% in other administrative zones. High-medium seroprevalence zone clustered along a northeast-southwest fringe and around the town. They comprised the highest and driest inhabited part of the municipality, where farmland was interspersed by residential detached houses, whilst null-low seroprevalence zones included larger farmland extensions and two small rural villages. Predominant vegetation and ground soil type were bush, non-irrigated fruit trees and conglomerate crust and sandstone in medium-high seroprevalence zones and irrigated grassland and fruit trees and colluvial deposits in null-low seroprevalence zones. Random effects logistic regression indicated that the prevalence of infection with L. infantum was higher for dogs sharing residence with infected dogs, increased until 5-6 years old and with body weight and was associated to increasing conglomerate crust and low surface water in the dog's zone of residence. The study confirms that L. infantum infection is endemic in this part of Spain and shows that prevalence can vary significantly within a small area depending on specific demographic and environmental factors conditioning the habitat of the local L. infantum vector, Phlebotomus perniciosus. It suggests similar low-scale variability is present in other geographically variable endemic areas and should be investigated to design Leishmaniosis risk maps and cost-effective, evidence-based, targeted control interventions."
The toxic unit approach as a risk indicator in honey bees surveillance programmes: A case of study in Apis mellifera iberiensis,"The influence of genetic diversity and exposure to xenobiotics on the prevalence of pathogens was studied within the context of a voluntary epidemiological study in Spanish apiaries of Apis mellifera iberiensis, carried out during the spring season of years 2014 and 2015. As such, the evolutionary lineages of the honey bee colonies were identified, a multiresidue analysis of xenobiotics was carried out in beebread and worker bee samples, and the Toxic Unit (TUm) was estimated for each sampled apiary. The relationship between lineages and the most prevalent pathogens (Nosema ceranae, Varroa destructor, trypanosomatids, Black Queen Cell Virus; and Deformed Wing Virus) was analysed with contingency tables, and the possible relationships between TUm and the prevalence of these pathogens were studied by using a factor analysis. The statistical analysis supported the associations between V. destructor and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), and between N. ceranae and Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), but the association between these pathogens and trypanosomatids was not observed. TUm values varied between 5.5 × 10−6 and 3.65 × 10−1. When TUm < 3.35 × 10−4, it was mainly determined by coumaphos, tau-fluvalinate and/or chlorfenvinphos. At higher values, other insecticides also contributed to TUm, although a clear predominance was not seen up to TUm ≥ 1.83 × 10−2, when it was mainly defined by acrinathrin, spinosad and/or imidacloprid. The possible cumulative effect from the joint action of xenobiotics was >10% in the 63% of the cases. The prevalence of pathogens did not appear to be influenced by the distribution of evolutionary lineages and, while the prevalence of V. destructor was not found to be determined by TUm, there was a trend towards an increasing prevalence of N. ceranae when TUm ≥ 23 10−4. This study is an example of using TUm approach beyond the field of the ecotoxicology."
Prevalence and Transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in People of Rural Communities of the High Jungle of Northern Peru,"Background Vector-borne transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi is seen exclusively in the Americas where an estimated 8 million people are infected with the parasite. Significant research in southern Peru has been conducted to understand T. cruzi infection and vector control, however, much less is known about the burden of infection and epidemiology in northern Peru. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection in humans (n=611) and domestic animals [dogs (n=106) and guinea pigs (n=206)] in communities of Cutervo Province, Peru. Sampling and diagnostic strategies differed according to species. An entomological household study (n=208) was conducted to identify the triatomine burden and species composition, as well as the prevalence of T. cruzi in vectors. Electrocardiograms (EKG) were performed on a subset of participants (n=90 T. cruzi infected participants and 170 age and sex-matched controls). The seroprevalence of T. cruzi among humans, dogs, and guinea pigs was 14.9%(95% CI: 12.2 -18.0%), 19.8% (95% CI: 12.728.7%) and 3.3% (95% CI: 1.4 -6.9%) respectively. In one community, the prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 17.2% (95% CI: 9.6 -24.7%) among participants < 15 years, suggesting recent transmission. Increasing age, positive triatomines in a participant's house, and ownership of a T. cruzi positive guinea pig were independent correlates of T. cruzi infection. Only one species of triatomine was found, Panstrongylus lignarius, formerly P. herreri. Approximately forty percent (39.9%, 95% CI: 33.2 - 46.9%) of surveyed households were infested with this vector and 14.9% (95% CI: 10.4 - 20.5%) had at least one triatomine positive for T. cruzi. The cardiac abnormality of right bundle branch block was rare, but only identified in seropositive individuals. Conclusions Our research documents a substantial prevalence of T. cruzi infection in Cutervo and highlights a need for greater attention and vector control efforts in northern Peru."
"A field survey on parasites and antibodies against selected pathogens in owned dogs in Lilongwe, Malawi","The aim of this study was to screen for selected parasites and antibody levels against vector-borne pathogens in owned dogs in Lilongwe, Malawi. The study population consisted of 100 dogs; 80 participating in vaccination-spaying campaigns and 20 visiting a veterinary clinic as paying clients. All dogs went through a general physical examination including visual examination for signs of ectoparasites. A total of 100 blood samples were analysed using commercial snap tests and 40 faecal samples by egg flotation in saturated sodium chloride. The sampled dogs had a seroprevalence of 12% for Anaplasma spp., 22% for Ehrlichia spp., 4% for Dirofilaria immitis and 1% for Leishmania spp. Eggs from Ancylostoma spp. were found in 80% of the faecal samples, whereas eggs of Trichuris vulpis, Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina were only present in 3%, 8% and 13% of the samples, respectively. Ectoparasites such as Ctenocephalides sp., Trichodectes sp. and ticks were present on 98%, 25% and 11%, respectively, of the campaign dogs. Among client dogs, 35% had Ctenocephalides fleas, 10% had Trichodectes lice and none had ticks. Public education and prophylactic treatment could be used to improve the animal welfare of dogs; this would most likely also have positive impact on public health."

"Sand flies (Diptera, Psychodidae, Phlebotominae) from Central Amazonia and four new records for the Amazonas state, Brazil","Sand flies from Central Amazonia and four new records for the Amazonas state, Brazil. A survey was conducted in May and June 2008 to study the fauna of insects in Central Amazonia, Brazil. As part of the survey, we report here that sixty species of phlebotomine were identified, totaling 13,712 specimens from 13 genera. The collection sites were located at the border between the states of Para and Amazonas, comprising three municipalities from the Amazonas state (Borba, Maues, and Nhamunda). Malaise, CDC and Shannon traps were used to collect the insects. Most of the sand flies were collected by CDC traps (89.5%), while Malaise and Shannon traps collected 7% and 3.5%, respectively. The most abundant genera, representing 97.1% of the total sand flies identified were: Trichopygomyia Barrett, 1962 (47.6%), Psathyromyia Barretto, 1962 (17.9%), Psychodopygus Mangabeira, 1941 (17.5%) and Thichophoromyia Barrett, 1962 (14.3%). The genera with the largest number of species identified were: Psychodopygus (14), Psathyromyia (10), Evandromyia Mangabeira, 1941(7), Trichophoromyia (5) and Thichopygomyia (5). The most abundant species was Trichopygomyia trichopyga (Floch & Abonnenc, 1945), which represented 29% of the total sand flies identified. Here we also report new records for four species in the Amazonas state: Ps. complexus (Mangabeira, 1941), Ps. llanosmartinsi Fraiha & Ward, 1980, Ty. pinna (Feliciangeli, Ramirez-Perez & Ramirez, 1989), and Th. readyi (Ryan, 1986). The results of this study provide new, additional information on the distribution of sand flies in the Amazon and increase the number of species in the Amazonas state from 127 to 131."
Comparison of three methods for diagnosis of Trypanosoma (Duttonella) vivax in cattle,"Detection of Trypanosoma vivax in cattle is based on parasitological, serological and molecular methods. The aim of this study was to compare three different methods for detecting T. vivax during an outbreak of trypanosomiasis in southeast Brazil. Blood samples were collected from seventy-two animals to perform microhematocrit centrifugation technique (MHCT), indirect fluorescent antibody (IFAT), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 84.72% (61/72) of the samples yielded a positive result in at least one test. The PCR test yielded the highest number of positives [73.6% (53/72)], followed by the IFAT [61.1% (44/72)] and MHCT [29.0% (21/72)]. Agreement among the three methods, as expressed by the kappa value, was poor. PCR proved to be the most sensitive of the three methods by demonstrating the highest positivity rate, even in the presence of low parasite levels. This work presents the first study comparing three different detection tests, to T. vivax, analyzing a relatively large-scale number of samples."
"Molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis of Trypanosoma evansi from dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Egypt, a pilot study","Animal trypanosomiasis is one of the major constraints of livestock industry in developing countries. In the present study, prevalence of Trypanosome evansi was assessed in the blood of dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) brought to Al Bassatein abattoir, Cairo, Egypt, by mouse inoculation test out of 84 tested camels, 4 animals (4.7%) were infected. Molecular analysis was achieved by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of part of ribosomal RNA gene including 18S, ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 regions. Despite the conserved nature of 18S region, ITS region showed obvious heterogeneity compared to analogous sequences in database. Analysis of transferrin receptor encoding gene (ESAG6) showed variable repertoire in the studied isolates, which may indicate to a novel structure of T. evansi population from Egypt and/or a difference in host range. Furthermore, analysis of variable surface glycoprotein RoTat 1.2 gene marker revealed some heterogeneity at this gene locus. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular analysis of T. evansi in Egypt. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Biodiversity, Leishmania genetic typing and host identification of phlebotomine species in endemic foci of southeastern Iran","Leishmaniasis is a growing health challenge in many parts of Iran, including Kerman Province. Investigating vector ecology and parasite-harboring capacity is prerequisite to the disease control measures. This study included six provincial sites namely Bam (Bm), Dehbakri (Di), Jiroft (Jt), Mohammad-Abad (Md), Rostam-Abad (Rd) and Darb-e-Behesht (Dt) where sand flies were trapped. The specimens were then identified before being exposed to DNA extraction. PCR-RFLP was used to detect leishmanial infection rates and feeding preference of vectors. Diversity indices indicated that the highest effective numbers of species was in plain sites, whereas, the highest expected numbers of species was in mountainous sites. P. papatasi and P. sergenti showed similar feeding preferences to both human and animal bloods. P. papatasi from indoor catches was found infected with Leishmania major at a 2% rate. The ITS1 gene sequences of isolated parasites were >99% similar to related GenBank haplotypes. Bam and Rostam-Abad remain active foci of both types of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Md and Di are prone to visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Jt is not at risk of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) due to absence of P. sergenti. Sand flies are absent in Dt, probably because of high elevation and cold climate. In conclusion, patterns of climate and ecosystem changes and vector-host-reservoirs interactions must be carefully scrutinized if leishmaniasis is to be controlled in the stricken sites.

"A Preliminary Parasitological Survey of Hepatozoon Spp. Infection in Dogs in Mashhad, Iran","Background: We attempted to determine the prevalence of Hepatozoon spp. infection in Mashhad, northeast of Iran, via blood smear parasitology. Methods: The prevalence was investigated by examination of blood smear parasitology, using blood samples collected from 254 dogs (51 strays and 203 privately owned-dogs). Results: Two stray dogs (2/51; 3.92%) and two privately-owned dogs (2/203; 0.98%) were infected with Hepatozoon spp. Therefore, as per blood smear parasitology, the prevalence of Hepatozoon spp. infection was 1.57% (4/254). Sixteen out of 254 dogs (6.29%) were infested with ticks; all of which were Rhipicephalus sanguineus. One of the dogs infected with Hepatozoon spp. exhibited ticks at the time of examination. Concurrent infection with Ehrlichia canis and Leishmania infantum was not detected in the four Hepatozoon spp. infected dogs. Conclusion: This is the first epidemiological study on the prevalence of Hepatozoon spp. infection in dogs in Iran."
Moroccan Leishmania infantum: Genetic Diversity and Population Structure as Revealed by Multi-Locus Microsatellite Typing,"Leishmania infantum causes Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in northern Morocco. It predominantly affects children under 5 years with incidence of 150 cases/year. Genetic variability and population structure have been investigated for 33 strains isolated from infected dogs and humans in Morocco. A multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) approach was used in which a MLMtype based on size variation in 14 independent microsatellite markers was compiled for each strain. MLMT profiles of 10 Tunisian, 10 Algerian and 21 European strains which belonged to zymodeme MON-1 and non-MON-1 according to multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) were included for comparison. A Bayesian model-based approach and phylogenetic analysis inferred two L. infantum sub-populations; Sub-population A consists of 13 Moroccan strains grouped with all European strains of MON-1 type; and sub-population B consists of 15 Moroccan strains grouped with the Tunisian and Algerian MON-1 strains. Theses sub-populations were significantly different from each other and from the Tunisian, Algerian and European non MON-1 strains which constructed one separate population. The presence of these two sub-populations co-existing in Moroccan endemics suggests multiple introduction of L. infantum from/to Morocco; (1) Introduction from/to the neighboring North African countries, (2) Introduction from/to the Europe. These scenarios are supported by the presence of sub-population B and sub-population A respectively. Gene flow was noticed between sub-populations A and B. Five strains showed mixed A/B genotypes indicating possible recombination between the two populations. MLMT has proven to be a powerful tool for eco-epidemiological and population genetic investigations of Leishmania."

Nonspecific Lymphocytic Myocarditis in Baboons Is Associated with Trypanosoma cruzi Infection,"Non-specific lymphocytic myocarditis (NLM) is frequently observed in baboons within the endemic range of Trypanosoma cruzi. We sought to determine whether T. cruzi infection is a cause of baboon NLM. We evaluated serial histologic sections of cardiac muscle, blood cultures, immunohistochemistry, serology, polymerase chain reaction, and clinical pathology from 31 baboons with NLM to determine whether T. cruzi infection is associated with NLM. Eleven baboons with no evidence of T. cruzi infection by serology and no NUM Were used its Controls. seropositivity for T. cruzi was 45% in baboons with NLM compared with a 2-3% colony prevalence. NLM lesion severity was significantly higher in seropositive than seronegative baboons with NLM. NLM was significantly more common in older baboons. No statistical association between NLM and sex, weight, or clinical pathology was found. These results suggest all association between NLM and T. cruzi infection in the baboon."
PREVALENCE OF TRYPANOSOMIASIS IN ZEBU CATTLE AT OBUDU RANCH - A TSETSE-FREE ZONE IN NIGERIA,"A recent cross-sectional survey of bovine trypanosomiasis at the Obudu Cattle Ranch (OCR), located at an altitude of 1576 m on the Obudu Plateau in Nigeria is presented. Blood samples from 68 adult cattle in three herds and 290 cattle (27 calves and 263 adults) in eight herds were screened for trypanosome infections in August 1989 and February 1990, respectively. Although the plateau is designated as tsetse-free, one (1.5%) (0.015, 95% confidence interval +/- 0.029) and four (1.4%) (0.014, 95% confidence interval +/- 0.013) of the ranch's cattle in August and February, respectively, had trypanosome infections. Trypanosoma brucei caused one of the infections while the others were caused by Trypanosoma vivax."
Epidemiological study on visceral leishmaniasis in the semiarid region of western Venezuela with special reference to inapparent infections,"An epidemiological study on visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the semiarid region of western Venezuela, where some acute cases have been previously reported, is recorded. A total of 1036 symptomless people's sera samples from 25 villages, and 67 dogs from 8 different localities, were tested by using 3 different serologic methods (DAT, IFAT, ELISA) and the polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR). Serological tests revealed 16.9% and 76.1% seropositive to Leishmania infantum in asymptomatic humans and dogs, respectively. In addition, a PCR assay detected the presence of L. infantum-specific DNA in 17.7% of the symptomless sampled individuals and in 29.9% of the tested dogs. The combined analyses of serologic and molecular findings demonstrate the presence of subclinical or inapparent VL infections in local people from this part of western Venezuela. The observed prevalence of VL in asymptomatic people is by itself a matter of concern from the epidemiological point of view. The present results also serve to call the attention to the presence of infected dogs as a risk factor in the maintenance of L. infantum as a source for infection to humans in the studied semiarid region. A total of 12 sand fly species were identified from 6000 specimens collected in 12 sampled villages, with a predominance of Lu. evansi (66.6%) over Lu. longipalpis (14.9%). In both sand fly species natural infection by L. infantum was detected using a PCR assay. It is concluded that the association among VL infected people, L. infantum-infected dogs and the presence of Lu. evansi, together with the observed poor sanitary and/or nutritional conditions, are risk factors to explain the high endemicity by VL at the semiarid region of western Venezuela."
"Heterogeneity in the prevalence and intensity of bovine trypanosomiasis in the districts of Amuru and Nwoya, Northern Uganda","Background: Livestock trypanosomiasis, transmitted mainly by tsetse flies of the genus Glossina is a major constraint to livestock health and productivity in the sub-Saharan Africa. Knowledge of the prevalence and intensity of trypanosomiasis is important in understanding the epidemiology of the disease. The objectives of this study were to (a) assess the prevalence and intensity of trypanosome infections in cattle, and (b) to investigate the reasons for the heterogeneity of the disease in the tsetse infested districts of Amuru and Nwoya, northern Uganda. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September, 2011 to January, 2012. Blood samples were collected from 816 cattle following jugular vein puncture, and screened for trypanosomes by HCT and ITS-PCR. A Pearson chi-squared test and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between location, age, sex, and prevalence of trypanosome infections. Results: Out of the 816 blood samples examined, 178 (22 %) and 338 (41 %) tested positive for trypanosomiasis by HCT and ITS-PCR, respectively. Trypanosoma vivax infection accounted for 77 % of infections detected by ITS-PCR, T. congolense (16 %), T. brucei s.l (4 %) and mixed (T. vivax/T. congolense/T. brucei) infections (3 %). The risk of trypanosome infection was significantly associated with cattle age (chi(2) = 220.4, df = 3, P < 0.001). The highest proportions of infected animals were adult males (26.7 %) and the least infected were the less than one year old calves (2.0 %). In addition, the risk of trypanosome infection was significantly associated with sex (.2 = 16.64, df = 1, P < 0.001), and males had a significantly higher prevalence of infections (26.8 %) than females (14.6 %). Conclusion: Our results indicate that the prevalence and intensity of trypanosome infections are highly heterogeneous being associated with cattle age, location and sex."
Prevalence of parasitic diseases among nomadic Fulanis of south-eastern Nigeria,"A study was carried out to determine the prevalence of parasitic infections among the nomadic Fulan's of south-eastern Nigeria between September 2003-March 2004. Urine, stool and blood specimens were collected from each of 231 subjects. Of these, 98 (42.4%) were infected with one or more of 14 parasitic species, of which Plasmodium malariae had the highest prevalence (15.3%). Others included 6 intestinal helminth parasites: Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Strongyloides stercoralis, Schistosoma mansoni, Enterobius vermicularis, Trichocephalus trichiurus, 2 protozoan parasites: Entamoeba histolytica and E. coli, 4 blood parasites: Mansonella perstans, Loa loa, Trypanosoma sp, Plasmodium falciparum, was well as Schistosoma haematobium recovered in the urine. Prevalence of these parasitic infections varied significantly among bush encamponents, sexes, and age groups. They had evidence of onchocerciasis. Their occupational imperatives, beliefs and general life style are contributing factors to the prevalence of parasitic infections among the nomadic Fulanis of south eastern Nigeria. Aspects of prevalence and control of parasitic infections are discussed."
"Canine visceral leishmaniasis in the Krenak indigenous community, Resplendor, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, 2007","The authors conducted a cross-sectional study of the local canine population in the Krenak indigenous community to detect parasites of the genus Leishmania and identify the circulating species and the proportion of asymptomatic dogs, while investigating associations between canine infection and the dogs' sex, age, and hair length. A seroepidemiological survey was performed, including 63 dogs. All the animals underwent clinical examination to verify the presence of characteristic signs, and serum samples were taken for serological tests (ELISA, IIF). Infected dogs culled by the health service were necropsied and the material was analyzed using molecular diagnostic techniques. The cross-sectional study detected a 46% prevalence rate, and the circulating species was Leishmania (L.) chagasi. The statistical analysis showed no association between infection and the independent variables. The study generated data on the epidemiological situation with canine infection in the area, which was previously unknown."
Blood protozoans in elasmobranchs of the family Rajidae from Galicia (NW Spain),"Blood smears from 132 skates Raja spp. captured on the continental shelf off Galicia (NW Spain) were examined for blood parasites. The skate species were Raja brachyura (n = 60), R. microocellata (n = 52) and a total of 20 specimens belonging to R, undulata, R. montagui and another 2 unidentified Raja species, all captured between March 1999 and March 2000. Two blood parasite species were found, Trypanosoma giganteum and Haemogregarina delagei. Of the 132 skates, 16% were infected only by T giganteum, 17% only by H. delagei, and 5% by both T giganteum and H. delagei. Both parasites showed highest prevalence in R. brachyura (22% T giganteum only, 38% H. delagei only, 12% T giganteum and H. delagei). Mean leucocyte percentages (n = 132 fish) were lymphocytes (43%), eosinophils (35%), neutrophils (20%) and monocytes (2%); basophils were not found. As far as we are aware, this eosinophil percentage is the highest reported to date for elasmo-branchs. We did not detect any statistically significant differences in leucocyte percentages between infected and uninfected fish, between male and female fish, among species or among weight groups."
"Epidemiological aspects and risk factors for infection by Leishmania infantum chagasi in dogs from municipality of Petrolina, Northeastern Brazil","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease of great concern for public health because of its high incidence and lethality. Here, we performed a serologic study of domestic dogs in the municipality of Petrolina in northeastern Brazil to evaluate the possible risk factors associated with canine seropositivity for Leishmania infantum chagasi. Blood samples from 1245 dogs in urban and rural areas were collected and examined by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The dogs were subjected to physical examination and classified according to their clinical manifestations. A questionnaire was administered to the owners to detect potential risk factors for infection with Leishmania spp. using logistic regression models. Of the 1245 dogs evaluated, 11.2% (140/1245) were seropositive in both tests (CI 95%: 9.5% to 13.1%). Approximately 60.7% of the reactive dogs were clinically suspect, with lymphadenomegaly, cutaneous ulcerations, onychogryphosis, pale mucous membranes and alopecia being the most obvious symptoms of infection. The seroprevalences in urban and rural areas were 5.4% (CI 95%: 4% to 7.1%) and 23.6% (CI 95%: 19.5% to 28.1%), respectively. The possible risk factors for the presence of anti L. infantum chagasi antibodies were the presence of a green area close to the home of the animal (OR = 3.63; p < 0.001), a mongrel breed (OR = 2.11; p = 0.025) and male gender (OR = 1.51, p = 0.034). The seroprevalence of L. infantum chagasi in the canine population is distributed in a heterogeneous manner, with a higher prevalence in rural areas.

"Seropositivity for Trypanosoma cruzi in domestic dogs from Sonora, Mexico","Background: Chagas disease is an important health problem in Latin America due to its incapacitating effects and associated mortality. Studies on seropositivity for Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexican dogs have demonstrated a direct correlation between seropositivity in humans and dogs, which can act as sentinels for the disease in this region. The objective of this study was to determine the seropositivity for T. cruzi infection in dogs from Sonora, a northern borderstate of Mexico. Methods: Responsible pet owners were selected at random from an urban area of Empalme municipality, Sonora, Mexico, and from there, 180 dog samples were collected. Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Reactive ELISA sera were processed by indirect immunofluorescence to confirm the presence of anti-T. cruzi antibodies. For the statistical analysis, chi-square tests were conducted. Results: Dogs' sera showed a seropositivity rate of 4.44%. The rate of seropositivity was not associated with the dogs' age, sex, or socioeconomics pertaining to the geographical area. One sample (1/180, 0.55%) showed the acute state of the disease. Conclusions: The study found a presence of anti-T. cruzi antibodies in dogs in this area, which suggests vector transmission. There is a need for active surveillance programs throughout the state of Sonora and vector control strategies should also be implemented in endemic regions."
PCR-specific detection of recently described Lotmaria passim (Trypanosomatidae) in Chilean apiaries,"The recently described trypanosome Lotmaria passim is currently considered the most predominant trypanosomatid in honey bees worldwide and could be a factor in honey bee declines. For a specific and quick detection of this pathogen, we developed primers based on the SSU rRNA and gGAPDH genes for the detection of L. passim in Chilean honey beehives. PCR products amplified and sequenced for these primers shared 99-100% identity with other sequences of L. passim. The designed primers were specific and we were able to detect a high prevalence (40-90%) of L. passim in bee hives distributed throughout Chile. Our described PCR-based method offers a feasible and specific detection of L passim in any honey bee samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Antibodies of Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania mexicana and Leishmania braziliensis in domiciled dogs in Tabasco, Mexico","Objective. To determine Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), Leishmania mexicana (L. mexicana) and Leishmania braziliensis (L. braziliensis) circulating antibodies in dogs from Chontalpa region in Tabasco, Mexico using ELISA diagnostic techniques Fe-SOD and Western blot. Materials and methods. For this study, 119 serums were obtained from domiciled dogs. Serums were tested for antibodies against T. cruzi, L. mexicana and L. braziliensis, using ELISA and Western Blot sod as diagnostic test. The antigenic fraction used in both tests was the Fe-SOD excreted by the species of Leishmania and Trypanosoma. Results. The obtained frequency in this study was 3.36% for T. cruzi, 9.24% for L. mexicana and 10.08% for L. braziliensis. Conclusions. The present study has demonstrated the presence of antibodies to these parasites in Chontalpa region from Tabasco, Mexico."
"Prevalence of antibodies against three species of Leishmania (L. mexicana, L. braziliensis, L. infantum) and possible associated factors in dogs from Merida, Yucatan, Mexico","Leishmania spp. has been recorded in humans and in dogs, and numerous studies have demonstrated that dogs act as reservoirs for visceral leishmaniasis. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of three species of the Leishmania genus and possible associated factors in sera of 218 dogs from two different populations in Merida, Yucatan (Mexico). The sera were analyzed to detect antibodies against L. mexicana, L. braziliensis, and L. infantum using the superoxide dismutase-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (SOD-ELISA) and Western blot as confirmation. The Fe-SOD excreted was used as the antigenic fraction for the three Leishmania species. The prevalence values found were 30.2% (L. mexicana), 8.2% (L. braziliensis), and 11.9% (L infantum), with L mexicana seroprevalence being greater than L braziliensis and L. infantum (p < 0.05). Five percent (11/218) of the dogs showed antibodies against L. mexicana/L. braziliensis, 5.5% (12/218) with L. mexicana/L. infantum and 1.8% (4/218) with L. mexicana/L. braziliensis/L. infantum. No relationship (p > 0.05) was found between antibodies against L. mexicana and breed, age, physical condition, or cutaneous lesions in dogs. This study provides evidence of antibodies against L mexicana, L. braziliensis and L infantum in dog populations from Merida, Mexico. (C) 2012 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

Prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and vertical transmission in Latin-American pregnant women in a health area of Biscay,"Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the epidemiological factors associated with it, and the risk of maternal-foetal transmission in pregnant women from endemic areas seen in the catchment area of Cruces Hospital (Basque Country, Spain). Methods: Descriptive study. Diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and neonates by performing serological tests and parasitological diagnosis using PCR. Epidemiological survey and multivariate analysis to identify the risk factors associated with T. cruzi infection. Results: A total of 158 women participated in the study between December 2008 and January 2010, with mean age of 28.5 (+/-5.3). Nineteen (12%) pregnant mothers were seropositive, of whom 16(84.2%) came from Bolivia, with a prevalence, in this group, of 22.2%. Independent epidemiological risk factors associated with T. cruzi infection were a history of living in mud houses (OR: 4.62; 95% IC: 1.54-13.87; P=.006) and knowledge of the vector (OR: 9.07; 95% IC: 1.91-43.11; P=.006). There was one newborn infected, which assumed a congenital transmission rate of 5.8% Conclusions: On the basis of the high prevalence of T. cruzi infection detected in Latin-American pregnant women and the risk of vertical transmission a screening program would be recommended, which would be fundamentally based on the identification of geographic origin and epidemiological variables.

"Seroprevalence Survey Of Zoonoses in Extremadura, Southwestern Spain, 2002-2003","Our aims were to determine the seroprevalence rates for the most common types of zoonosis among the population of Extremadura (southwestern Spain) and to identify the associated risk factors. We conducted a seroepidemiological survey to collect information on family background and the habits of people residing in Extremadura between 2002 and 2003. Antibodies to Brucella were determined by Rose Bengal staining and a standard tube agglutination test; a titer of 1/80 was considered to be positive. Antibody titers for spotted fever, leishmaniasis, echinococcosis, and toxoplasmosis were determined by enzyme-immunoassays. Independent risk factors identified were age (younger age for brucellosis), male gender (brucellosis, spotted fever, and toxoplasmosis), occupation and contact with animals (brucellosis and spotted fever for those in contact with goats, hydatidosis for those in contact with sheep, leishmaniasis for those in contact with dogs, and toxoplasmosis for those in contact with cats and pigs), and consuming contaminated food (brucellosis by eating fresh cheese, hydatidosis by eating homemade sausages, and toxoplasmosis by eating pork). Except for leishmaniasis, the other zoonoses were more prevalent in rural areas, and, with the exception of brucellosis, they were all more prevalent in Badajoz. The distribution of zoonoses in Extremadura was strongly influenced by keeping livestock and eating habits. Thus, brucellosis was more prevalent in Caceres (associated with cheese consumption), while toxoplasmosis (pork consumption) and spotted fever (from hunting) were more common in Badajoz."
"Seroepidemiology of leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, and leishmaniosis among dogs in Ankara, Turkey","Seroprevalence of five different Leptospira interrogans serovars, Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania infantum in stray dogs in Ankara was investigated. A total of 116 dog sera collected from apparently healthy stray dogs were tested for L interrogans serovars by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), for T gondii antibodies by Sabin-Feldman dye test (SFDT), and for L. infantum antibodies by indirect fluoresence antibody test (IFAT). Of the 116 dogs, 51 (43.96%) were seropositive for leptospirosis, 72 (62.06%) for T gondii and 3 (2.58%) for L. infantum. No statistically significant difference was observed between male and female dogs in the seroprevalences of toxoplasmosis and leptospirosis (P > 0.05), but statistically significant difference was observed among different age groups in the seroprevalences of toxoplasmosis and leptospirosis (P < 0.05). Although the seroprevalence of L. infantum was low, asymptomatic animals should be considered as a reservoir for the spread of the disease. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Spatial, temporal, molecular, and intraspecific differences of haemoparasite infection and relevant selected physiological parameters of wild birds in Georgia, USA","The prevalence of five avian haemoparasite groups was examined for effects on health and associations with extrinsic factors. Overall, 786 samples were examined from six sites in two Georgia (USA) watersheds, during breeding and non-breeding periods in 2010 and 2011. Among the four most commonly infected species, Haemoproteus prevalence was significantly higher in Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) compared to Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea) and Tufted Titmice (Baeolophus bicolor) while prevalence in White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) was significantly higher than in Indigo Buntings. Higher prevalence of Plasmodium was noted in Tufted Titmice and Northern Cardinals. While Leucocytozoon prevalence was highest in White-throated Sparrows, Trypanosoma prevalence was highest in Tufted Titmice. Interesting differences in infection probabilities were noted between foraging guilds with Haemoproteus associated with low-middle level strata and birds in the middle-upper strata were more likely to be infected with Plasmodium and Trypanosoma. In contrast, ground-foraging birds were more likely to be infected with Leucocytozoon. Breeding season was correlated with higher polychromasia counts and higher prevalence of Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Trypanosoma. In addition, prevalence of infection with certain haemoparasite genera and packed cell volume (PCV) were different among host species. Body mass index was inversely correlated with prevalence of microfilaria infection but positively related to Haemoproteus infection. However, we found no relationship between PCV or polychromasia levels with haemoparasite infection. Molecular characterization of 61 samples revealed 19 unique Haemoproteus (n = 7) and Plasmodium (n = 12) haplotypes with numerous new host records. No differences were noted in haplotype diversity among birds with different migratory behaviors or foraging heights, thus additional studies are needed that incorporate molecular analysis, host biology, and vector biology into comprehensive models on parasite ecology. Detailed morphological examination of these parasites is also necessary to determine if closely related haplotypes represent single species or morphologically distinct, but closely related, haplotypes.

Camel trypanosomosis in Morocco 1: results of a first epidemiological survey,"An epidemiological survey of camel trypanosomosis was conducted for the first time in Morocco in 1997 and 1998. Five provinces located in the south and southeast of the High Atlas mountain chain were included in this study. A total number of 1460 serum samples were collected and tested by a card agglutination test for trypanosomosis (CATT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (Ab-ELISA) to detect anti-Trypanosoma evansi antibodies. The overall seroprevalence was 14.1% by CATT and 18.2% by Ab-ELISA. Two very active foci were identified in Zagora and Merzouga with high Ab-ELISA prevalences of 43.3 and 35.4%, respectively, for each area. The concordance between the CATT and Ab-ELISA was 94.1%. The age-related distribution of seroprevalence showed a tendency for the infection rate to increase with age up to a maximum in the 7-10 year-old group. Clinical examination revealed that enlargement of lymph nodes was the most frequent sign in seropositive animals (79.7%). The comparison of haematocrit values of seropositive and seronegative animals showed a significant difference that indicated severe anaemia in infected animals. Isolation of the parasite by inoculation of mice allowed us to collect 15 T evansi isolates from Zagora and three from Merzouga. The study showed that the Saharan provinces of Morocco were slightly affected by camel trypanosomosis but two hyperendemic foci, Zagora and Merzouga, were found to be sources of contamination for the surrounding regions.

Seroprevalence of Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis Around the Aegean Cost of Turkey,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an infectious and zoonotic disease of people, wild and domestic mammals residing in tropical and subtropical climate zone. VL is a potential risk for human health and regarding the economical loss as a result of the disease, endemic areas should be recognized the effective implementation of control measures, and detailed epidemiological surveys should be performed in an attempt to obtain information about the incidence and prevalence of the disease in locations where the disease is diagnosed. Besides, in our country, most of the traveling has been drifted to areas dominating Mediterranean climate increasing the importance of investigations on visceral leishmaniais in Aegean region. In this study, it was aimed to determine the seroprevalence of the infection from Selcuk/Izmir, Turgutlu/Manisa, Aydin city province, Kusadasi/Aydin, Marmaris/Mugla, Bodrum/Mugla in stray dogs that are regarded as the main reservoirs for Visceral Leishmaniasis. For this purpose, anti-leishmania antibodies were determined with immunofluorence antibody diagnostic prosedure in serum samples obtained from untreated and unprotected 300 stray dogs located in these settlements. According to the results of the study 27 (9%) out of a total 300 dogs were infected with canine visceral leishmaniasis (CanL). It was considered that the result of this study may be used as a reference for further studies regarding human and dogs residing in Turkey."
A cross-sectional sero-epidemiological study of canine leishmaniasis in Greek mainland,"Canine leishmaniasis is endemic in Greece as in other countries of the Mediterranean basin. In this study, the regional prevalence of canine seropositivity to Leishmania spp. in Greek mainland was simultaneously assessed in 7 different regions. A total of 2620 serum samples were collected from clinically healthy dogs and were tested for anti-L. infantum antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A high degree of agreement (kappa = 0.96) was observed between these two tests. The seroprevalence rate in the whole study population was nearly 20%, being highest among dogs living in Attiki (30.12%) and lowest for those living in Florina (2.05%). There was no difference in terms of the gender of the dogs, their length of hair coat or their utility; on the contrary, seroprevalence rates were significantly higher among dogs in the age groups of 1-3 years (23.39%)and 3-9 years (23.35%) than in younger (2.26%) or older (6.03%) dogs. Epidemiological data on the seroprevalence of canine leishmaniasis provide indirect information on the prevalence of the infection and the disease and are necessary to implement and then to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures.

"Prevalence study and risk factor analysis of selected bacterial, protozoal and viral, including vector-borne, pathogens in cats from Cyprus","Background: Feline infectious agent studies are lacking in Cyprus. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and risk factors for various feline infectious agents, including feline vector-borne pathogens (FVBP), in cats from Cyprus. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive, multicentre study was performed on 174 feline samples [138 owned and 36 shelter-feral, including both healthy (43) and non-healthy (131), cats] from private veterinary clinics from all six districts of Cyprus. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were used to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), "" Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum"" (CMhm) and "" Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis"" (CMt). The population was tested for four FVBP including Bartonella henselae and Leishmania spp. using qPCR, while conventional PCR assays were used to detect Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Serological assays were performed to detect Leishmania infantum antibodies, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed to test associations and possible risk factors between variables and infectious agents. Results: Ninety-six (55.2%) of the 174 cats were PCR-positive for at least one infectious agent. Forty-six cats (26.4%) were haemoplasma positive, including 13 (7.5%) for Mhf, 36 (20.7%) for CMhm and 12 (6.9%) for CMt. Sixty-six cats (37.9%) were positive for Hepatozoon spp., while 19 (10.9%) were positive for B. henselae, four (2.3%) for Leishmania spp. and one (0.6%) for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. Sequencing revealed the presence of Hepatozoon felis, L. infantum and Anaplasma platys. Of the 164 cats that underwent retroviral serology, 10 (6.1%) were FeLV-positive and 31 (18.9%) were FIV-positive, while L. infantum serology was positive in 7 (4.4%) of the 160 cats tested. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significant associations for various infectious agents including L. infantum with each of Hepatozoon spp. and CMt infection. Conclusions: A high prevalence of infectious agents was found in cats from Cyprus with Mhf, CMhm, CMt, L. infantum, B. henselae, H. felis, A. platys, FeLV and FIV infections reported for the first time. The significant associations between different pathogens provide a better understanding of similarities in the epidemiology of these pathogens and interactions between them."
High prevalence of Trypanosoma vegrandis in bats from Western Australia,"The present study describes the first report of Trypanosoma vegrandis in bats using morphology and sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA gene. The PCR prevalence of T. vegrandis in bats was 81.8% (18/22). The high prevalence of T. vegrandis in the present study suggests that bats may play an important role in the epidemiology of T. vegrandis in Australia. T. vegrandis appears to be geographically dispersed, has a wide distribution in Australia and low levels of host specificity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Vector of Trypanosoma copemani identified as Ixodes sp,"A total of 41 ticks were collected from 15 quokkas on Bald Island and 2 ticks from a Gilbert's potoroo from Two Peoples Bay. Three species of Ixodid ticks Ixodes australiensis, Ixodes hirsti and Ixodes myrmecobii were identified on the quokkas known to have a high prevalence of Trypanosoma copemani. Tick faeces from ticks isolated from 8 individual quokkas and a Gilbert's potoroo were examined with one identified as positive for trypanosomes. Faecal examination revealed trypanosomes similar to in vitro life-cycle stages of T. copemani. In total 12 ticks were dissected and trypanosomes found in sections of their midgut and haemolymph, 49 and 117 days after collection. Tick faeces, salivary glands and midguts from I. australiensis were screened using an 18S rRNA PCR with amplification seen only from the midguts. Sequencing showed 100% homology to T. copemani (genotype A) and 99.9% homology to the wombat (AII) isolate of T. copemani. Trypanosomes were only detected in I. australiensis as neither I. hirsti nor I. myrmecobii survived the initial 30-day storage conditions. We therefore identify a vector for T. copemani as I. australiensis and, given the detection of trypanosomes in the faeces, suggest that transmission is via the faecal-oral route."
Trypanosome Diversity in Wildlife Species from the Serengeti and Luangwa Valley Ecosystems,"Background: The importance of wildlife as reservoirs of African trypanosomes pathogenic to man and livestock is well recognised. While new species of trypanosomes and their variants have been identified in tsetse populations, our knowledge of trypanosome species that are circulating in wildlife populations and their genetic diversity is limited. Methodology/Principal Findings: Molecular phylogenetic methods were used to examine the genetic diversity and species composition of trypanosomes circulating in wildlife from two ecosystems that exhibit high host species diversity: the Serengeti in Tanzania and the Luangwa Valley in Zambia. Phylogenetic relationships were assessed by alignment of partial 18S, 5.8S and 28S trypanosomal nuclear ribosomal DNA array sequences within the Trypanosomatidae and using ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 for more detailed analysis of the T. vivax clade. In addition to Trypanosoma brucei, T. congolense, T. simiae, T. simiae (Tsavo), T. godfreyi and T. theileri, three variants of T. vivax were identified from three different wildlife species within one ecosystem, including sequences from trypanosomes from a giraffe and a waterbuck that differed from all published sequences and from each other, and did not amplify with conventional primers for T. vivax. Conclusions/Significance: Wildlife carries a wide range of trypanosome species. The failure of the diverse T. vivax in this study to amplify with conventional primers suggests that T. vivax may have been under-diagnosed in Tanzania. Since conventional species-specific primers may not amplify all trypanosomes of interest, the use of ITS PCR primers followed by sequencing is a valuable approach to investigate diversity of trypanosome infections in wildlife; amplification of sequences outside the T. brucei clade raises concerns regarding ITS primer specificity for wildlife samples if sequence confirmation is not also undertaken."
Cattle trypanosomosis: The diversity of trypanosomes and implications for disease epidemiology and control,"Trypanosomosis is one of the most significant infectious threats to cattle in sub-Saharan Africa, and one form has also spread to Asia and South America. The disease is caused by a complex of trypanosome species, and the species and strain of parasite can have a profound influence upon the epidemiology of the host–parasite–vector relationships, the severity and course of infection, and, consequently, the implementation and development of control methods. This review will summarise our current knowledge of the relationship between trypanosome species/genotype and the phenotype of disease in cattle, and the implications that this has for ongoing efforts to develop diagnostics, drugs and vaccines for the control of cattle trypanosomosis."
"The diversity, distribution and host-parasite associations of trypanosomes in Western Australian wildlife","Little is known regarding the diversity, distribution or host-parasite associations of Trypanosoma spp. in Australian wildlife. Here we report on an investigation based on divergence of the 18S rRNA gene of trypanosomes isolated from a range of hosts and varied geographical locations. A total of 371 individuals representing 19 species of native animals from 14 different locations were screened. In total, 32 individuals from 9 different species tested positive for the parasite. Phylogenetic analysis revealed considerable parasite diversity with no clear geographical distribution and no evidence of host specificity. In general, it appears that Australian Trypanosoma spp. are widespread, with several genotypes appearing in multiple host species and in varied locations including both mainland areas and offshore islands. Some host species were found to be susceptible to multiple genotypes, but no individuals were infected with more than a single isolate."
Trypanosoma and Leishmania have clonal population structures of epidemiological significance,
Serologic and Molecular Evaluation of Leishmania infantum in Cats from Central Spain,"Infection by different Leishmania spp. in cats has been reported in many countries. In Spain, since the first Leishmania infection described in 1933, sporadic clinical cases in cats have been reported. Various serologic studies performed in other areas of Spain have shown seroprevalences ranging between 1.7 and 60%. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of leishmaniasis in cats from Central Spain (Madrid), and to assess the existence of associations between Leishmania infantum infection and relevant data obtained from each cat. Two-hundred thirty-three cats attended at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Madrid between September 2005 and June 2006 were tested for L. infantum using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test (cutoff:1:100) and PCR. PCR testing was performed on the samples to detect Leishmania infection, targeting the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). Our results showed a seroprevalence of 1.29% (3/233) using IFA test. Another seven cats were also seroreactive to L. infantum one dilution under the cutoff (1:50). Considering all the seroreactive samples, the percentage of positive animals to L. infantum was 4.29%. Only one of the cats (0.43%) included in the study was PCR-positive. Relative lymphocytosis and an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value were statistically associated with seroreactivity to L. infantum. Our results demonstrate the presence of cats seroreactive to L. infantum in Central Spain, an endemic area for this disease in dogs."
Hematobiochemical Disorder in Camels Suffering from different Hemoparasites,"Haemoparasites disturb camel production in tropical countries. Four major haemoparasites in camels are Trypanosoma, Dipetalonema, Babesia, and Anaplasma. The current study was executed to investigate haematobiochemical alterations in camels during haemoparasitism. Blood samples were collected from 200 camels of either sex and different ages from district Attock. Samples were processed for haematobiochemical analysis and thin smear stained with Field stain according to standard procedure. Out of 200 camels 46% of them have blood parasites. Trypanosoma was the most prevalent (32.5%) followed by diptelonemiasis (8%). Babesia and Anaplasma was seen in 3% camels. Prevalence of diptelonemiasis was significantly higher in young than older camels. Blood analysis revealed that blood parasites infection in camels results in decrease in PCV, Hb, RBC and PLT values and increase in TLC values. On the other hand, serum analysis revealed increase in ALT, AST, ALP and GGT while decrease in total protein and albumin (p>0.05)."
"The prevalence of antinuclear, anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies in a group of healthy blood donors","We studied the prevalence of antinuclear (ANA), anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA), anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies in a group of 93 blood donors [age range: 18-58 years]. Antinuclear and anti-ds DNA antibodies were detected by immunofluorescence [IF] using HEp2 cells and Crithidia luciliae as substrates, respectively, while anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies were assayed by ELISA. ANA was found In 6.5% while anti-dsDNA antibodies were not detected in any of the subjects. The 98th percentile was used as cut off where values greater than 0.651 for anti-Sm and 0.601 for anti-RNP antibodies were taken to be positive. This gives a frequency of 1.1% for both antibodies. There was no significant association of antibody positivity with sex or race. We conclude that certain autoantibodies are present in low titres in the normal Malaysian individuals, at a different frequency compared to other studies probably due to genetic,ethic or environmental factors."
PCR-based detection of Leishmania major kDNA within naturally infected Phlebotomus papatasi in southern Iran,"The annual incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Iran rose by 43% over a five year period, from 2002 to 2006; most of these cases were caused by Leishmania major. Two complementary standard and nested polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were used to detect parasites within their natural vector, Phlebotomus papatasi. Twelve different sand fly species were morphologically identified. The most abundant species (31.3%) was P. papatasi. Leptomonads were found in nine (2.4%) phlebotomines. Twenty (5.3%) sand fly species were found positive for Leishmania-genus DNA using standard PCR. The infection rate of this species was 5% and 7% by microscopic and molecular methods, respectively.

Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in French Guiana,A survey was carried out on 1487 individuals to assess the seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection French Guiana. The overall prevalence of T. cruzi specific IgG was 0.5 %. In multivariate analysis. residence in areas where housing is favorable for the presence of triatomine bugs was the only factor associated with the presence of T. cruzi antibodies. These results have implications for public health since blood donors are not routinely screened for T. cruzi infection in French Guiana.
"Lutzomyia Sand Fly Diversity and Rates of Infection by Wolbachia and an Exotic Leishmania Species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama","Background: Sand flies ( Diptera, Psychodidae, Phlebotominae) in the genus Lutzomyia are the predominant vectors of the protozoan disease leishmaniasis in the New World. Within the watershed of the Panama Canal, the cutaneous form of leishmaniasis is a continuous health threat for residents, tourists and members of an international research community. Here we report the results of screening a tropical forest assemblage of sand fly species for infection by both Leishmania and a microbe that can potentially serve in vector population control, the cytoplasmically transmitted rickettsia, Wolbachia pipientis. Knowing accurately which Lutzomyia species are present, what their evolutionary relationships are, and how they are infected by strains of both Leishmania and Wolbachia is of critical value for building strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease in humans. Methodology and Findings: We collected, sorted and then used DNA sequences to determine the diversity and probable phylogenetic relationships of the Phlebotominae occurring in the understory of Barro Colorado Island in the Republic of Panama. Sequence from CO1, the DNA barcoding gene, supported 18 morphology-based species determinations while revealing the presence of two possible ""cryptic'' species, one (Lu. sp. nr vespertilionis) within the Vespertilionis group, the other ( Lu. gomezi) within the Lutzomyia-cruciata series. Using ITS-1 and ""minicircle'' primers we detected Leishmania DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapidoi, 26.3% of Lu. gomezi individuals and in 0% of the other 18 sand fly species. Identical ITS-1 sequence was obtained from the Leishmania infecting Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi, sequence which was 93% similar to Leishmania ( viannia) naiffi in GenBank, a species previously unknown in Panama, but recognized as a type of cutaneous leishmaniasis vectored broadly across northern and central South America. Distinct strains of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia were detected in three of 20 sand fly species, including Lu. trapidoi, in which it frequently co-occurred with Leishmania. Conclusions: Both morphological and molecular methods were used to examine an assemblage of 20 sand fly species occurring in the forests of the Panama Canal area. Two of these species, members of separate clades, were found to carry Leishmania at high frequency and hence are likely vectors of leishmaniasis to humans or other mammal species. A single Leishmania species, identified with high confidence as Le. naiffi, was carried by both species. That Le. naiffi is known to cause cutaneous lesions in South America but has hitherto not been reported or implicated in Panama opens the possibility that its range has recently expanded to include the Isthmus or that it occurs as a recent introduction. The occurrence of Leishmania and Wolbachia in Lu. trapidoi identifies one important vector of the disease as a potential target for gene introductions using Wolbachia population sweeps."
Epidemiology of Visceral Leishmaniasis in Georgia,"This study investigated the transmission and prevalence of Leishmania parasite infection of humans in two foci of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in Georgia, the well known focus in Tbilisi in the East, and in Kutaisi, a new focus in the West of the country. The seroprevalence of canine leishmaniasis was investigated in order to understand the zoonotic transmission. Blood samples of 1575 dogs (stray and pet) and 77 wild canids were tested for VL by Kalazar Detect rK39 rapid diagnostic tests. Three districts were investigated in Tbilisi and one in Kutaisi. The highest proportions of seropositive pet dogs were present in District #2 (28.1%, 82/292) and District #1 (26.9%, 24/89) in Tbilisi, compared to 17.3% (26/150) of pet dogs in Kutaisi. The percentage of seropositive stray dogs was also twice as high in Tbilisi (16.1%, n = 670) than in Kutaisi (8%, n = 50); only 2/58 wild animals screened were seropositive (2. 6%). A total of 873 Phlebotomine sand flies were collected, with 5 different species identified in Tbilisi and 3 species in Kutaisi; 2.3% of the females were positive for Leishmania parasites. The Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) was performed on 981 human subjects in VL foci in urban areas in Tbilisi and Kutaisi. A particularly high prevalence of LST positives was observed in Tbilisi District #1 (22.2%, 37.5% and 19.5% for ages 5-9, 15-24 and 25-59, respectively); lower prevalence was observed in Kutaisi (0%, 3.2% and 5.2%, respectively; P<0.05). This study shows that Tbilisi is an active focus for leishmaniasis and that the infection prevalence is very high in dogs and in humans. Although exposure is as yet not as high in Kutaisi, this is a new VL focus. The overall situation in the country is alarming and new control measures are urgently needed."
Sylvatic foci of the Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans in Chile: description of a new focus and challenges for control programs,"Triatoma infestans is one of the main domestic vectors of Chagas disease. Reports of wild habitat occurrences have recently increased. In Chile, after a successful elimination campaign of T. infestans domestic infestation, a sylvatic focus was reported in bromeliads in the metropolitan region. Here, we report a new focus of sylvatic T. infestans inhabiting rock piles in the Valparaiso region in central Chile. All T. infestans captured were nymphal instars living among the stones, which were inhabited by several mammal species, along with the sylvatic triatomine vector Mepraia spinolai. We found a prevalence of infection with Trypanosoma cruzi of 36.54% in T. infestans, similar to the previous report for sylvatic specimens from bromeliads. Sylvatic populations of T. infestans should be studied at different geographic scales to elucidate their role in the maintenance of the sylvatic transmission cycle of T. cruzi and their possible role in threatening the domestic elimination of this vector. This information should be used to redesign the control programs in Chile to avoid the re-establishment of the domestic cycle."
"Prevalence of trypanosomes from Clarius batrachus (Linnaeus) of Purba Medinipur, West Bengal, India","Haemoflagellates of the genus Trypanosoma Gruby, 1843 are prevalent in fresh water fishes and are transmitted by leech. A total of 133 Clairus batrachus were examined for haemoflagelates. The fishes were collected from ponds and water bodies of Purba Medinipur district, West Bengal, India, from January 2006 to July, 2007. The slides were prepared taking blood from both males (97) and females (36). It was found that only 19 out of 36 (52.78%) females and 31 out of 97 (31.95%) males were infected. Thus females were recorded with a higher Prevalence of trypanosome infection than males. There was a significant difference (P<0.05) in the infection rate with trypanosomes in males and females.

"Local variation of haemoparasites and arthropod vectors, and intestinal protozoans in spiny mice (Acomys dimidiatus) from four montane wadis in the St Katherine Protectorate, Sinai, Egypt","Haemoparasite infections and infestations with potential arthropod vectors were assessed in spiny mice Acomys dimidiatus from four wadis in the arid montane region of the southern Sinai in Egypt in late summer 2000. Five taxa of haemoparasites (Haemobartonella spp. 80%, Hepatozoon sp. 20.6%, Trypanosoma acomys 17.5%, Bartonella spp. 2.5% and Babesia sp. 1.9%) were recorded. Additionally, infections with two intestinal protozoa, Cryptosporidium cf. parvum and Giardia sp., were quantified, both with similar prevalence (17.0 and 17.6%, respectively). 17.9% of mice carried fleas (Parapulex chephrensis and Xenopsylla dipodilli) and 32.1% had lice (Polyplax oxyrrhyncha and Polyplax brachyrrhycha combined). Marked differences in the prevalence and abundance of infections were detected between the four wadis, particularly with respect to T. acomys, Hepatozoon sp. and fleas, which were largely aggregated in just two of the four sites (Wadis Gharaba and Tlah). In contrast, the intestinal protozoa were more common, and abundance was higher, in Wadi El Arbaein. Intrinsic factors also contributed to a variation in prevalence, with strong age-dependent increases in the prevalence and abundance of Hepatozoon sp., higher mean species richness, prevalence of Cr. cf. parvum, and abundance of Giardia sp. and Hepatozoon sp. in female mice. Haemobartonella spp. showed an age-dependent reduction in abundance and higher abundance among male mice. A weak association was found between the prevalence of T. acomys and its putative flea vector. The single extrinsic factor in the study, site of capture, was more important than the intrinsic factors in explaining variation in the prevalence and abundance of haemoparasites, intestinal protozoa and arthropod vectors. In the high mountains of southern Sinai, the parasite fauna of spiny mice is distinct in each wadi, and hence we expect the parasites to exert spatially different co-evolutionary pressures on their hosts, with a resultant variation in host life histories."
Factors affecting the component community structure of haemoparasites in bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) from the Mazury Lake District region of Poland,"The prevalence and abundance of infections with haemoparasites were studied over a 3 year period in Clethrionomys glareolus (bank vole, n = 420) sampled from forests in the NE of Poland. Total species richness was 5 (Prevalence = Haemobartonella sp. 63.1 %, Bartonella grahamii 27.4 %, Hepatozoon erhardovae 31.4 %, Trypanosoma evotomys 15 degrees, and Babesia microti 1.0 % ) with 81.9 %, of the voles carrying at least 1 species and a mean infracommunity; species richness of 1 1. Variation in species richness was determined primarily by season and year, and the interaction of these factors. The observed frequency distribution of intracommunity species richness did nor differ from that predicted by a null model, suggesting that there were no marked associations between the species. Analyses of prevalence and abundance of infection with each species in turn, revealed that overall the principal causes of variation were temporal and seasonal and their interaction, intrinsic factors such as age and sex playing only a miller role. However,. the relative importance of specific extrinsic, and rarely intrinsic, factors varied and was distinct for each of the species in the study. Prevalence data revealed 1 sets of 2-way associations between en species, most varyingly dependent on combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Analysis of quantitative associations suggested 4 sets of positive 2-way interactions, 3 of which remained after controlling for the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on the abundance of each species, but only one could be unequivocally accepted (Haemobartonella sp. + B. grahamii) after correction for multiple comparisons. These data are discussed in the context of the changing ecological profiles in this region of Eastern Europe and, in a wider context, in relation to current understanding of the factors which shape component community structures of haemoparasites in wild rodents."
"Molecular and seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis in West Anatolia, Turkey","Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is a protozoal disease caused by Leishmania species. Dogs play an important role as a reservoir. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of CanL by molecular and serological techniques among stray dogs living in kennels in Aydin, Manisa, and Izmir, located in western Turkey. Blood samples were collected from a total of 191 dogs and analyzed using indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The isolates that tested positive using PCR were further analyzed by real-time PCR for species identification and confirmation. A total of 21 (10.99%) dogs were found to be seropositive by IFAT. Molecular analysis revealed that 8 (4.19%) of the examined dogs were positive for L. infantum/donovani complex and two were found to be positive only by genus-specific PCR. The findings obtained from the screened animals indicate a higher risk of getting an infection caused by a Leishmania spp. in areas where the study was carried out. With this field study, it was obvious that to control the spread of disease into nonendemic areas, preventive measures like application of long-acting topical insecticides to infected and uninfected dogs should be taken. If necessary, positive dogs should be treated according to international guidelines and kept under control."
Leishmania donovani populations in Eastern Sudan: Temporal structuring and a link between human and canine transmission,
Leishmania tropica in Stray Dogs in Southeast Iran,"Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania tropica is endemic in Kerman, southeastern Iran. While dogs have long been implicated as the main domestic reservoirs of L. infantum, etiological agent of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL), they can also carry L. tropica infection. The objective of the present study was to determine molecular identity and to evaluate histopathological changes due to CL in dogs in a well-known focus of anthroponotic CL (ACL) in Kerman, southeastern Iran. Methods: This study was carried out in three prospective series from 1994 to 2013 on dogs. Tissue samples were taken from 471 stray dogs. Pathological specimens including skin, spleen, liver and lymph nodes were prepared for paraffin blocks, sectioning and staining for further histopathological examination. PCR amplification of kDNA was performed to identify the causative agent and sequencing. Overall, two out of 471 stray dogs were infected with L. tropica. Hyperplasia of red pulp by the proliferation of histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells and cytoplasm of histiocytes collection of amastigotes was noted. Results: Based on the results of PCR products and sequencing analysis, the parasites isolated from the lesions of two dogs were characterized as L. tropica, corresponding to a band of 830 bp Conclusion: This finding revealed infection with L. tropica in stray dogs in the city and suburbs of Kerman. This information is essential for public health concerns and planning effective future control programs. The role of dogs as potentional reservoir in the epidemiology of ACL needs further investigation."
"Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis in Kerman, Southeast of Iran: A Seroepidemiological, Histopathological and Molecular Study","Background: Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is a systemic disease with a high mortality rate, caused by a diphasic protozoan parasite, Leishmania infantum/chagasi in the world. The objective of the present study was to determine the presence of CVL in the city and suburbs of Kerman, using a range of serological, histopathological and molecular methods. Methods: Blood samples were taken from 80 clinically symptomatic stray dogs All the collected blood samples were tested by direct agglutination test (DAT) to detect the anti-Leishmania antibodies in dogs, using a cut-off value of >= 1: 320. Pathological specimens including spleen, liver and lymph nodes were prepared for paraffin blocks, sectioning, staining and final microscopic examination in the pathology laboratory. PCR amplification of kDNA from 9 samples of DAT positive stray dogs was studied. Results: The anti-Leishmania antibody was detected in 9 dogs (11.25 %) of the total 80 studied dogs. No significant difference was found between VL infection and gender. In contrast, there was a significant difference between seropositivity and age (P<0.05). Pathological samples showed changes including hyperplasia of infected macrophages and inflammatory cells that occupied sinusoids and splenic cords. Among the samples which was characterized by PCR, only one specimen revealed to be mixed infection between L. infantum and L. tropica. Conclusion: The results revealed a high prevalence of L. infantum infection in stray dogs in Kerman. This kind of information is needed for implementation of future control programs."
"Triatoma sordida Stal 1859 (Hemiptera, Reduviidae : Triatominae) in palms of northeastern Argentina","Several palms species provide an important habitat for triatomines and associate vertebrates in tropical America. The objective of this work is to identify the triatomine species living in the palms of rural areas in the Province of Corrientes, and to estimate the potential epidemiological risk they represent for the residents of nearby houses. The survey was carried out in a palm community in Colonia Laurel, Department San Roque, Province of Corrientes, Argentina. Samplings were performed in October: November and December 1998: January, February, and March 1999, May and June 1999. Thirty palms. 27 (90%) Butia yatay (Mart.) Becc. and 3 Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd ex Mart. were dissected. Triatoma sordida Stal 1859 was found in 96.2% of B. yatay and in all the A. aculeata palms. A total of 272 live T. sordida was collected; 36 of them (13.2%) were found in bird nests in the frond and the remainder in other locations of the tree. The mean number of triatomines per palm was 9.6 (range 1-60, mode 2). T. sordida was collected during all the sampling months and all stages were present at all seasons. The highest population density it as reached in spring and the lowest in autumn. Trypanosoma cruzi was detected in 38.5% in feces of 174 examined insects and identified as such, both by microscopical examination and PCR. This is the first finding of T. sordida populations in B. yatay, an endemic palm of South America distributed in southern Brazil, Uruguay and northeastern Argentina. The high infection prevalence, found in this work suggests that T. sordida plays an essential role in the maintenance of the wild T. cruzi transmission cycle in northeastern Argentina."
,"The present study describes the first report of Trypanosoma vegrandis in koalas using morphology and sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA gene. The prevalence of T. vegrandis in koalas was 13.6% (6/44). It is likely that the small size of T. vegrandis (<10 mu m in length), coupled with the difficulties in amplifying DNA of this parasite in mixed infections using trypanosome generic primers, are the reason why this organism has not been identified in koalas until now. This study highlights the importance of further research comprising a larger sample size to determine the prevalence of T. vegrandis in koalas as well as its potential impacts upon this marsupial species' health.

"Prevalence, genetic diversity and potential clinical impact of blood-borne and enteric protozoan parasites in native mammals from northern Australia","A molecular survey was conducted to provide baseline information on the prevalence, genetic diversity and potential clinical impacts of blood-borne and enteric protozoans in native wild mammals from the Northern Territory (NT). A total of 209 blood and 167 faecal samples were collected from four target species; the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) and brush-tailed rabbit-rat (Conilurus penicillatus). Blood samples were screened by PCR at the 18S rRNA gene for trypanosomes, piroplasms and haemogregarines, with faecal samples tested for Cryptosporidium spp. at the 18S rRNA locus, and for Giardia spp. at the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and 18S rRNA loci. The potential clinical impact was investigated by associating clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters with presence or absence of infection. Overall, 22.5% (95% CI: 17.0-28.8%) of the animals tested were positive for haemoprotozoans. Trypanosomes were found in 26.6% (95% CI: 18.7-35.7%) of the bandicoots and were identified as Trypanosoma vegrandis G6, except for one unique genotype, most similar to T. vegrandis G3 (genetic distance = 7%). The prevalence of trypanosomes in possums was 23.7% (95% CI: 11.4-40.2%), and the genotypes identified clustered within the T. noyesi Glade. The presence of Babesia sp. and Hepatozoon sp. was confirmed in bandicoots only, both at a prevalence of 9.7% (95% CI: 2.7-9.2%). The total prevalence of intestinal protozoan parasites observed was relatively low (3%; 95% CI: 1.0-6.9%). No evidence of clinical disease associated with protozoan parasitic infection was observed, however bandicoots positive for Trypanosoma exhibited a significantly lower packed cell volume (PCV) compared to negative bandicoots (p = 0.046). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first research conducted in the NT to characterise protozoan parasites in threatened native mammals using both molecular and morphological tools; and to assess the potential clinical impacts of these agents. The absence of clear signs of major morbidity in infected animals seems to exclude a direct association between infections with these agents and possible population decline events in northern Australian native mammals However until the cause(s) of population decline are ascertained for each individual mammal species, further studies are required. The outcome of the present investigation may be used to inform wildlife conservation and zoonotic disease programs."
Increased genetic diversity and prevalence of co-infection with Trypanosoma spp. in koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) and their ticks identified using next-generation sequencing (NGS),"Infections with Trypanosoma spp. have been associated with poor health and decreased survival of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus), particularly in the presence of concurrent pathogens such as Chlamydia and koala retrovirus. The present study describes the application of a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay to characterise the prevalence and genetic diversity of trypanosome communities in koalas and two native species of ticks (Ixodes holocyclus and I. tasmani) removed from koala hosts. Among 168 koalas tested, 32.2% (95% CI: 25.2-39.8%) were positive for at least one Trypanosoma sp. Previously described Trypanosoma spp. from koalas were identified, including T. irwini (32.1%, 95% CI: 25.2-39.8%), T. gilletti (25%, 95% CI: 18.7-32.3%), T. copemani (27.4%, 95% CI: 20.8-34.8%) and T. vegrandis (10.1%, 95% CI: 6.0-15.7%). Trypanosoma noyesi was detected for the first time in koalas, although at a low prevalence (0.6% 95% CI: 0-3.3%), and a novel species (Trypanosoma sp. AB-2017) was identified at a prevalence of 4.8% (95% CI: 2.1-9.2%). Mixed infections with up to five species were present in 27.4% (95% CI: 21-35%) of the koalas, which was significantly higher than the prevalence of single infections 4.8% (95% CI: 2-9%). Overall, a considerably higher proportion (79.7%) of the Trypanosoma sequences isolated from koala blood samples were identified as T. irwini, suggesting this is the dominant species. Co-infections involving T. gilletti, T. irwini, T. copemani, T. vegrandis and Trypanosoma sp. AB-2017 were also detected in ticks, with T. gilletti and T. copemani being the dominant species within the invertebrate hosts. Direct Sanger sequencing of Trypanosoma 18S rRNA gene amplicons was also performed and results revealed that this method was only able to identify the genotypes with greater amount of reads (according to NGS) within koala samples, which highlights the advantages of NGS in detecting mixed infections. The present study provides new insights on the natural genetic diversity of Trypanosoma communities infecting koalas and constitutes a benchmark for future clinical and epidemiological studies required to quantify the contribution of trypanosome infections on koala survival rates."
"Synanthropic triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae): infestation, colonization, and natural infection by trypanosomatids in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil","Introduction: The ecoepidemiological situation in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil is characterized by frequent invasion and colonization of domiciliary units (DUs) by several triatomine species, with high rates of natural infection by Typanosoma cruzi. Methods: We evaluated the possibility of vector transmission of T. cruzi based on records of the occurrence of domiciled triatomines collected by the Secretariat of State for Public Health from 2005 to 2015. During this period. 67.7% (113/167) of municipalities conducted at least one active search and 110 recorded the presence of insects in DUs. These activities were more frequent in municipalities considered to have a high and medium-level risk of T. cruzi transmission. Results: Of 51,569 captured triatomines, the most common species were Triatoma brasiliensis (47.2%) and T. pseudomaculata (40.2%). Colonies of T. brasiliensis, T. pseudomaculata, T. petrocchiae, Panstrongylus lutzi, and Rhodnius nasutus were also recorded in the intradomicile and peridomicile. Natural infection by trypanosomatids was detected in 1,153 specimens; the highest rate was found in R. nasutus (3.5%), followed by T. brasiliensis (2.5%) and T. pseudomaculata (2.4%). There have been high levels of colonization over the years; however, not all infested DUs have been sprayed. Conclusions: This is the first report of intradomicile and peridomicile colonization by P. lutzi. These results demonstrate the risk of new cases of infection by T. cruzi and reinforce the need for continuous entomological surveillance in the State of Rio Grande do Norte."
PREVALENCE OF HEMATOZOA INFECTIONS AMONG BREEDING AND WINTERING RUSTY BLACKBIRDS,"The Rusty Blackbird (Euphugus carolinus) has declined precipitously over the past several decades, and stressors on both the breeding and wintering grounds are suspected causes. Over 3 years, we collected blood samples from breeding birds in Alaska and Maine and from wintering birds in Mississippi and Arkansas to determine the prevalence of hematozoan infections at different times of the year. The prevalence of hematozoa (percent of birds infected) in Alaska was 44% of 43 birds, lower than previously reported from Newfoundland and Ontario (83% of 23 birds). Blood parasites were found among 67% of 12 Rusty Blackbirds sampled in Maine, not different from the prevalence in Newfoundland and Ontario. Leucocytozoon was the most common parasite; few breeding birds were infected with Plasmodium or Trypanosoma sp. During the winter in Mississippi and Arkansas, the overall prevalence of hernatozoa was 49% over three years. In winter as in summer, Leucocytozoon was the most commonly encountered parasite (n = 62 birds), followed by Haemoproteus (n = 5), microfilaria (n = 2), Trypanosoma (n = 2), and Plasmodium (n = 1). The prevalence of hematozoa among wintering Rusty Blackbirds was much higher than expected because winter is generally a time when there are few transmissions and in most birds blood parasites are absent from the peripheral circulation. This high prevalence might indicate a nonseasonal relapse of hematozoan infections among wintering birds; possibly due to high levels of stress, which are known to lower the immune response and trigger nonseasonal relapses."
Canine Chagas' Disease (American Trypanosomiasis) in North America,"Chagas' disease, or American trypanosomiasis, caused by the hemoflagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (class Zoomastigophorea and family Trypanosomatidae), is the leading cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in man. In dogs in North America, Chagas disease mainly occurs in working dogs in southeastern Texas. It is likely that most dogs become infected by eating infected vectors, causing the release of the organisms into the mouth of the host. Most dogs are diagnosed during the chronic stage of the disease, which is typified by dilated cardiomyopathy and malignant ventricular-based arrhythmias. This article reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and available therapy for Chagas' disease in dogs."
THE LESIONS AND PREVALENCE OF TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI IN OPOSSUMS AND ARMADILLOS FROM SOUTHERN LOUISIANA,"The prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi in 48 opossums and 98 armadillos from southern Louisiana was studied. Sixteen opossums (33.3%) and 1 armadillo (1.1%) were positive for T. cruzi by blood culture. Hearts from 45 opossums and the tissues from the 1 blood culture-positive armadillo were available for histopathological examination. Although histopathology revealed T. cruzi pseudocysts in 6 opossums, 2 were not positive on blood culture. Therefore, 18 opossums (37.5%) were positive for T. cruzi. Twenty-two of 45 opossums had histological evidence of myocarditis. No lesion typical of infection with T. cruzi was observed in the armadillo tissues. These results substantiate that the opossum is a current reservoir host of T. cruzi infection in southern Louisiana and that armadillos may be of relatively minor importance."
SEROLOGIC AND BLOOD CULTURE SURVEY OF TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI INFECTION IN 4 CANINE POPULATIONS OF SOUTHERN LOUISIANA,"Blood culture and serologic testing were used to study the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a group of 85 dogs from southern Louisiana rural environment. These dogs were known to have been in contact with wild mammalian hosts of the hemoflagellate. Results were compared with blood culture and serologic test results in 103 dogs from a rural environment and with limited known wild mammalian T cruzi host contact. Serologic test results for the 188 dogs from the rural environment were compared with results for 176 dogs from an urban animal shelter and for 100 household pet dogs from an urban southern Louisiana environment. Blood culture was not performed on urban dogs. Culture results were negative in all dogs from rural environments. Serologic evidence of infection was obtained for 4 of the 85 (4.7%) dogs of rural environment with known host contact. Of 176 dogs from the animal shelter, 4 (2.3%) had high antibody titer to T cruzi, and 11 others had low titer (< 2 adjusted ELISA units [aEU]). Two and 4 dogs of the housed urban and rural groups, respectively, had antibody titer to T cruzi that was < 2 aEU. Results indicate that prevalence for exposure to T cruzi antigen is higher in dogs with high potential contact with the vector and wild mammalian hosts of T cruzi, whether they are from rural or urban environment. Furthermore, results indicate that similar studies on high-risk human populations may be indicated."
Trypanosoma madeirae sp. n.: A species of the clade T-cruzi associated with the neotropical common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus,"Molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed the growing diversity of bat trypanosomes. Here, 14 isolates from blood samples of the vampire bat Desmodus rotundus (Phyllostomidae) from Rio de Janeiro, Southeast Brazil, were cultivated, and morphologically and molecularly characterized. All isolates represent a novel species named Trypanosoma madeirae n. sp. positioned in the Neobat lineage of the clade T. cruzi. The Neobat lineage also comprises closely related trypanosomes of clades Neotropic 1, 2 and 3 from diverse phyllostomid species. Trypanosomes of Neotropic 1, found in Trachops cirrhosus and Artibeus jamaicensis (phyllostomids), likely represent a different species or genotype closely related to T. madeirae. Consistent with its phylogenetic positioning, T. madeirae differs from Trypanosoma cruzi in morphology of both epimastigote and trypomastigote culture forms and does not infect Triatoma infestans. Similar to its closest relatives of Neobat lineage, T. madeirae was unable to develop within mammalian cells. To date, PCR-surveys on archived blood/liver samples unveiled T. madeirae exclusively in D. rotundus from Southern to Northern Brazil. The description of a new species of bat trypanosome associated with vampire bats increases the repertoire of trypanosomes infecting D. rotundus, currently comprised of Trypanosoma cruzi, T. cruzi marinkellei, Trypanosoma dionisii, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma pessoai, and Trypanosoma madeirae."
"Visceral Leishmaniasis Caused by Leishmania infantum in Salta, Argentina: Possible Reservoirs and Vectors","Cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) were not recorded until recently in the Chaco region of northwestern Argentina. Dogs were surveyed at the sites of infection of two HVL index cases in the Chaco region of Salta province. Canine cases (CanL) were diagnosed by two parasitological methods, two molecular methods targeting mini- and maxicircle DNA, and immunochromatographic dipstick. Among 77 dogs studied, 10 (13%) were found infected with Leishmania spp. In seven dogs and two humans, the infecting species was typed as Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. The same genotype was detected in the human and two of the CanL. Although several diagnostic methods displayed weak or moderate agreement, the concordance values for serology versus maxicircle PCR were very good (Kappa index = 0.84). Sandflies captured in the area were identified as Lutzomyia migonei and Lu. cortelezziau. sallesi (cortelezzii complex). The focal appearance of leishirnaniasis in dogs and humans in a sylvatic region and its relatively low prevalence of infection suggests that L. (L.) infantum transmission to dogs and humans may, in this region, stem from sylvatic reservoirs."
Parasitic fauna of spiny eel Mastacembelus mastacembelus from Greater Zab river in Iraq,"A total of 128 spiny eels Mastacembelus mastacembelus (Mastacembelidae) were collected from the Greater Zab river at Iski Kalak town, west of Erbil city, Kurdistan region, Iraq, from July 2007 to the end of June 2008. The fish were examined for ecto and endo parasites. The study revealed the existence of 16 species of parasites (with a total prevalence of 89.06%) including: two species of protozoans (Trypanosoma sp. and Trichodina pediculus), one species of monogenetic trematodes (Mastacembelocleidus heteranchorus), six species of digenetic trematodes (Allocreadium transversale, Asymphylodora macracetabulum, Pseudochetosoma salmonicola, Clinostomum complanatum, Diplostomum flexicaudum and D. spathaceum), two species of cestodes (Polyonchobothrium magnum and Ligula intestinalis), two species of nematodes (Agamospirura sp. and Procamallanus viviparus), one species of leech, crustacean and arachnoide (Cystobranchus mammillatus, Argulus foliaceus and Arrenurus sp. respectively). Five species of these parasites (T. pediculus, A. transversale, D. flexicaudum, C. mammillatus and Arrenurus sp.) were recorded for the first time in Iraq. In addition, M. mastacembelus was regarded as a new host for A. macracetabulum, C. complanatum and A. foliaceus."
"Molecular detection of Trypanosoma evansi in cattle from Quirino Province, Philippines","Trypanosoma evansi is a protozoan parasite which ubiquitously infects livestock in the Philippines. The study depicts an initial report of livestock trypanosomes in cattle from the province of Quirino, Philippines using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Out of 246 field blood samples from apparently healthy cattle collected from five municipalities of Quirino Province, Philippines, 3/246 (1.22%) were established positive for T evansi using PCR. The positive animals identified were from the municipality of Saguday (3/42; 7.14% prevalence). These were composed of one female and two males species and belonged to variable age groups (1.1-2 yrs, 2.1-3 yrs and >3 yrs). In addition, the data on the physical examination of the sampled animals using the nine-point scale body condition scoring system showed that the top three body condition scores (BCS) were 3[Very thin, (107/246; 43.50%)], 4[Thin, (75/246; 30.50%)] and 2[Emaciated, (46/246; 18.70%)]. Furthermore, the data showed that majority of the animals in Diffun and Saguday were thin (BCS 4) while most of the animals in Cabarroguis and Maddela and Aglipay were classified under BCS 3(Very thin) and BCS 2(Emaciated) respectively. Consequently, all the Trypanosoma evansi positive animals appeared thin (BCS= 4) and were from the municipality of Saguday. No parasites were observed after blood parasite examination (BPE). The study provides information on the first report of T evansi cases in cattle from Quirino Province located in Region 2 of the Philippines. Consequently the data also presents the first molecular detection of T. evansi infection in cattle in the province of Quirino, Philippines."
Trypanosomiasis by Trypanosoma vivax in cattle in the Brazilian semiarid: Description of an outbreak and lesions in the nervous system,"An outbreak of trypanosomiasis by Trypanosoma vivax is reported in the semiarid of Paraiba, Northeastern Brazil from May to August 2002. Sixty-four cows out of 130 were affected; 11 died and the other recovered after treatment with diminazene aceturate. Affected animals had fever, anemia, weight loss, hypoglycemia, increased serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and, in nine cows, nervous signs. All cows with nervous signs died; six of them recovered after treatment, but the disease relapsed. Six cows aborted and one delivered a calf that died immediately after parturition. Thirty-two out of 100 calves were affected and five died. Nervous signs were not observed in the calves. Gross lesions were thickening of the meninges, enlarged lymph nodes and prominent white pulp of the spleen. The main histological lesion was meningoencephalitis and malacia in the brain of cows with nervous signs. No antibodies against trypanosomes were found in 33 blood samples collected before the outbreak in the affected farm and in 29 samples collected at the same time in two other neighbor farms. Until January 2003, all 89 animals tested had antibodies against T vivax, suggesting the occurrence of sub clinical infections in cattle without clinical signs. Only two out of 85 serum samples collected on April 2004 were positive for T vivax antibodies. Data obtained suggested that the semiarid region is non-endemic for trypanosomiasis and that disease occurred due to introduction of the parasite in a susceptible population after an apparent rise in the Tabanus spp. population.

"Highly debilitating natural Trypanosoma vivax infections in Brazilian calves: epidemiology, pathology, and probable transplacental transmission","Clinical, epidemiological, and pathological aspects of trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma vivax in calves were reported for the first time in northeast Brazil. Clinical and epidemiological data, packed cell volumes (PCV), and parasitemia were assessed in 150 calves in May 2009 (rainy season-survey 1) and in 153 calves in November 2009 (dry season-survey 2) in three farms (A, B, and C). Prevalence of T. vivax in calves examined in the survey 1 was 63.3%, 65.0%, and 80.0% in farms A, B, and C, respectively. Morbidity varied from 63.3% to 80%, mortality from 15% to 30% and lethality from 23% to 37.5%. In survey 1, for all farms, high parasitemia (from 30.3 to 26.2x10(6) parasites/mL), fever (from 39.8 to 40.3 degrees C), low PCV (from 15.7% to 18.1%), and body score (from 2.5 to 3.5) were detected. Calves showed depression, weight loss, pale mucous membranes, enlarged lymph nodes, edema of the dewlap, cough, coryza, and diarrhea. The animals from farms A and B were treated with diminazene aceturate. Six months after, in survey 2, non-treated calves from farm C showed values for prevalence (81.82), morbidity (81.82), mortality (12.73), and lethality (15.55) similar to those in survey 1 (P>0.05). Also in survey 2, four calves aging merely 1-3 days old presented high parasitemia levels (from 32x10(6) to 74x10(6) parasites/mL), suggesting transplacental transmission. In conclusion, trypanosomiasis by T. vivax constitutes high prevalent disease for calves raised in Brazilian semiarid and may have transplacental transmission."
"Genetic variability of trypanosomatids isolated from phytophagous Hemiptera defined by morphological, biochemical, and molecular taxonomic markers","In the present study, we investigated the genetic variability among 49 new isolates of trypanosomatids from phytophagous Hemiptera by means of morphological characters, growth features, and biochemical (enzymes of ornithine-arginine cycle) and molecular markers (based on spliced-leader, and ribosomal genes). From 402 phytophagous insects dissected and examined for the presence of trypanosomatids, 228 species belonging to Pyrrhocoridae, Coreidae, Lygaeidae, and Pentatomidae families harbored trypanosomatids in their salivary glands, or digestive tubes. Among these insects, 211 carried promastigotes and only 17 had choanomastigote forms. The results show a strong association among morphology, growth features, and biochemical and molecular markers and reveal the genetic diversity of the isolates, which were assigned to Crithidia, Phytomonas, and Leptomonas: we found genetic polymorphism within all these genera, thus indicating high genetic variability among trypanosomatids from phytophagous insects."
PRODUCTIVITY AND HEALTH OF CAMELS (CAMELUS-DROMEDARIUS) IN SOMALIA - ASSOCIATIONS WITH TRYPANOSOMIASIS AND BRUCELLOSIS,"In Somalia, one of the world's largest dromedary populations of about 5-3 million animals are kept by nomadic pastoralists under traditional management. Interest in the development potential of camel herds in the semi-arid areas of central Somalia initiated an investigation to determine the productivity of herds, their major diseases and likely associations among these parameters. Using a systems approach, data were collected for herd production parameters, environmental factors, management and production systems, and health variables. One thousand and thirty nine camels in 33 herds were studied in the central regions of Somalia. Trypanosoma evansi prevalence ranged from 1.7% in blood-smears to 56.4% using enzyme-linked immunosorbent micro-assay (microELISA). Seroprevalence for brucellosis was determined as 1.9% by the standard agglutination test (SAT) and 0.3% by the complement fixation test (CFT). Using multiple regression, 15% of the total variation of the general fertility rate was explained by the results of the microhaematocrit centrifugation technique (MHCT) and the microELISA for T. evansi, CFT results for brucellosis, herdsize, and young stock death rate. Among herd production variables, herd size differed significantly for different management units. Young stock death rates, as well as general fertility rates varied in the ecological subzones with a marked effect in the zones labeled ""Inland"". Various other associations were noted among demographic, husbandry and disease variables. The importance of trypanosomosis and brucellosis to the productivity of herds and measures to control their limiting effects on production were discussed."
"Parasite prevalence in Dark-eyed Juncos, Junco hyemalis, breeding at different elevations","During the summer of 2001, Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) were captured within the lowest (1000 m above sea level) and highest (2000 m asl) elevation extremes of their breeding range in Jasper National Park, Alberta. Blood samples were taken to identify parasite genera, and to test for differences in parasite prevalence among elevations. The most common parasites at either elevation were Haemoproteus spp., Leucocytozoon spp., and Trypanosoma spp. A significantly higher proportion of low- compared to high-elevation birds was infected by at least one of these, supporting the prediction that high-elevation habitats may be refuges from parasites."
"Transmission Risk of Trypanosoma cruzi in Metztitlan Municipality from Hidalgo State, Mexico, by Characterization of Domiciliary Units and their Entomologic Indexes","In order to determine the risk of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi by triatomines in Metztitlan municipality, Hidalgo State, Mexico, entomological indexes were calculated and the characteristics of dwellings were described. A transversal, retrospective, descriptive, and observational study was performed by means of an intentional not probabilistic and expertise sampling from January to December of 2005 in 10 localities in which presence of triatomines were investigated either intra or peridomestic environmental in 699 houses. Building material and presence of infected triatomines with T. cruzi were registered to determine entomologic indexes. The triatomine species collected were: Triatoma barberi (Usinger) and T. mexicana (Herrich-Schaeffer) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae). The results indicated that natural infection index varied from 7.7% to 50%; colonization index reached 80%; infestation index varied from 7.7% to 25%; dispersion index was 70%. Stone-walled houses were more infested. We can conclude that it is necessary to establish T. cruzi transmission control measures against triatomines in localities from Metztitlan, primarily in stone-walled houses where T. barberi occurs, as it was the most important vector species in the transmission of T. cruzi in this municipality."
"Prevalence and host related risk factors of bovine trypanosomosis in Hawagelan district, West Wellega zone, Western Ethiopia","A survey was conducted in Hawagelan district, West Wellega zone, western Ethiopia from November 2009 to March 2010 to determine the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis and the prevailing species of trypanosomes as well as to assess host related risk factors. Blood samples collected from 384 randomly selected cattle were subjected to parasitological and haematological analysis. The overall prevalence was found to be 8.6%. Trypanosoma congolense was the predominant species in the area (72.7%). The prevalence among the species of trypanosomes showed statistically significant difference (P<0.05). However, it was not statistically significant between sex and the different age groups (P>0.05). The mean packed cell volume (PCV) value of the infected animals was lower (20.8%+/-3.2) compared to non-infected animals (24.9%+/-3.8). There was statistically significant difference (P<0.05) in the PCV values of infected and non-infected animals. Moreover, animals with different body condition exhibited statistically significant variation (P<0.05) in the prevalence of trypanosomosis. Finally, this work showed that trypanosomosis is an important disease affecting the health and productivity of cattle in the district. Hence, due attention should be given to this sector so as to improve livestock production and agricultural development in the area."
Reliability of techniques used in the diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis by the national control program in Brazil: A survey in an area of recent transmission,"One of the key components of the Brazilian Program for the Control of Visceral Leishmaniasis (PCLV) is the euthanasia of Leishmania-infected canine reservoirs, the detection of which depends on a screening procedure involving a Dual Path Platform (DPP) immunoassay and a confirmatory enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The aims of the present study were to evaluate the reliability of these techniques in a region of recent transmission of canine VL, to follow up the seroconversion 3-4 months after the initial diagnosis of DPP reactive but ELISA indeterminate or non-reactive dogs, and to identify the species of Leishmania in circulation in the area. Each animal was submitted to DPP under field conditions, performed by municipal health workers using peripheral blood (DPP-field), to DPP under laboratory conditions using serum (DPP-lab) and to ELISA using serum. The agreements between the tests were determined using McNemar's chi(2) test, Cohen's kappa coefficient (k) at the 95% confidence interval and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). Of the 1130 dogs examined, 74.2% were non-reactive in all three tests applied. Based on the PCLV positive-infection criterion, seroprevalence was 8.9% (101/1130) with 83.2% (84/101) of infected animals showing reactivity in all three tests while 7.8% (8/101) were reactive in DPP-field and ELISA and 8.9% (9/101) in DPP-lab and ELISA. The proportions of disagreements were substantial in all comparisons. Inter-rater reliability between DPP-field and ELISA (k = 0.55; PABAK = 0.78) and DPP-lab and ELISA (k = 0.59; PABAK = 0.81) were considered moderate, while that between DPP-field and DPP-lab (k = 0.61; PABAK = 0.79) was classified as marginally good. The proportion of seroconversions in DPP reactive animals that were initially ELISA indeterminate was significantly higher than in those that were DPP reactive but initially ELISA non-reactive. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed the presence of Leishmania infantum, the etiologic agent of VL, in bone marrow samples from VL-infected animals. Our data showed that the techniques and protocols currently employed in the PCLV screening approach are not entirely reliable. Further consideration should be given to monitoring dogs with undetermined results in ELISA and a better training should be provided for health workers responsible for performing DPP tests applied under field conditions.

First detection of Leishmania DNA in Psammomys obesus and Psammomys vexillaris: Their potential involvement in the epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Tunisia,"Leishmaniasis, a public health problem in Tunisia, are diseases caused by different Leishmania species. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is present from the North to the South under different forms, due to Leishmania (L.) major, L. infantum or L. tropica. Whereas, Psammomys (P.) obesus is the confirmed reservoir host of L. major, those of L. tropica and dermotropic L. infantum wait to be identified. Importantly, P. vexillaris species have been recently highlighted; however, no studies have been carried out to explore its potential role in leishmaniasis epidemiology. Seventy two rodents were collected from Central and South-West of Tunisia between 2007 and 2010. Using several methods, 43 animals were identified as P. obesus and 29 as P. vexillaris. Leishmania kinetoplast DNA was detected in liver samples by real-time PCR in 18 P. obesus and in 8 P. vexillaris. Then, the direct sequencing of the amplified internal transcribed spacer 1, allowed the identification of L. infantum DNA in five P. obesus and in three P. vexillaris, as well as L. tropica DNA in three other P. vexillaris. Whereas, PCR fluorescent fragment length analysis of the 7 spliced leaders, allowed identifying L. major among infected P. obesus and P. vexillaris, and interestingly co-infection (L. major/L. infantum) among two P. obesus. We report here for the first time, the infection of P. obesus, from Central Tunisia, by L. infantum. Suggesting that P. obesus the known reservoir host of L. major, may also serve as reservoir host for L. infantum and thus play a role in the spread of sporadic cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis in this region. Of equal importance, this work establish for the first time, the natural infection of P. vexillaris by different Leishmania species, suggesting its potential epidemiological role as reservoir host."
"Temporal dynamics and Leishmania infantum infection prevalence of Phlebotomus perniciosus (Diptera, Phlebotominae) in highly endemic areas of visceral leishmaniasis in Tunisia","Phlebotomus perniciosus is one of the major vectors of Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean basin. The aim of this work was (i) to provide information about abundance and temporal dynamics of this Larroussius species in a hot spot area of visceral leishmaniasis in Tunisia, (ii) to detect L. infantum DNA in wild caught female sandflies and (iii) to measure Phlebotomus perniciosus infection rate throughout the active season. Sandflies were collected monthly during one year using CDC miniature light-traps in house and in animal shelters. Male specimens were identified at species level according to morphological characters. Female specimens were conserved individually for molecular study. Leishmania infection was tested by kinetoplast DNA real-time PCR and ITS-1 PCR-sequencing. Subsequent sandfly species identification of infected specimens was done by mitochondrial cytochrome b sequencing. In one year period, overall 4,441 specimens (2230 males and 2211 females) were collected. Sandfly activity started in end-April and ended in early-November. Mean sandfly density in house was significantly lower than in animal shelters (51 +/- 50 versus 504 +/- 460 sandflies/CDC night, p<0.05). However, a higher proportion of females was found in house (58.4% versus 49.2%, p<0.001). Based on species identification of male specimens, Phlebotomus perniciosus was the dominant species (56% of the whole male sandfly fauna, p<0.0001). It showed two peaks of density in the active season, a sharp one in early May and a higher long lasting one from end-July to end-September. DNA was extracted from 190 female specimens randomly sampled and corresponding to 96 specimens from house and 94 from animal shelters. Twenty four female sandfly were infected by Leishmania infantum. All infected specimens were recognized as Phlebotomus perniciosus. Leishmania infantum infection rate in female sandflies was 2.3 fold higher in house than in animal shelters (17.7% versus 7.4%, p<0.05). In house, estimated number of infected specimens was the highest at the end of the active season. Abundance, dynamics of density and Leishmania infantum infection prevalence of Phlebotomus perniciosus in Tunisian hot spot of visceral leishmaniasis highlight the major role of this Phlebotominae species in L. infantum transmission."
Detection of Leishmania infantum DNA in conjunctival swabs of cats by quantitative real-time PCR,"Although some studies have investigated the potential role of cats as a reservoir for Leishmania, their role in the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is still poorly understood. Molecular diagnostic techniques are an important tool in VL diagnosis, and PCR shows high sensitivity and specificity for Leishmania spp. detection. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a method that permits quantitative analysis of a large number of samples, resulting in more sensitive, accurate, and reproducible measurements of specific DNA present in the sample. This study compared real-time PCR (qPCR) and conventional PCR (cPCR) for detection of Leishmania spp. in blood and conjunctival swab (CS) samples of healthy cats from a non-endemic area in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Of all CS samples, 1.85% (2/108) were positive for Leishmania spp. by both cPCR as qPCR (kappa index = 1), indicating excellent agreement between the two methods. The DNA from the two CS-cPCR- and CS-qPCR-positive samples was further tested with a PCR test amplifying the Leishmania spp. discriminative rRNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1), of which one sample generated a 300-350-bp DNA fragment whose size varies according to the Leishmania species. Following sequencing, the fragment showed 100% similarity to a GenBank L. infantum sequence obtained from a cat in Italy. In conclusion, the association of qPCR and CS proved to be effective for detection of Leishmania in cats. Conjunctival swab samples were shown to be a practical and better alternative to blood samples and may be useful in the diagnosis and studies of feline leishmaniasis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A HOST-PARASITE CATALOG OF THE HEMATOZOA OF THE SUB-SAHARAN BIRDS,"The prevalence of avian haematozoa in 826 species of birds representing 73 families of sub-Saharan birds as recorded in the literature or in the fifes of the International Reference Centre for Avian Haematozoa and the Veterinary Research Institute is presented. The most commonly occurring blood parasites were members of the genus Haemoproteus which were represented by 63 species which occurred in 19,1 % of the sample. Twenty-five species of Leucocytozoon were recorded in 8,3 % of the birds and represented the second most frequently encountered group of haematozoa. Species of Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, and filarioids (as microfilariae) occurred in 3,5 %, 2,5 % and 2,8 % respectively of the birds sampled; species of Aegyptianella, Atoxoplasma, Babesia and Hepatozoon were infrequently seen. An annotated list of the birds examined for haematozoa is presented and brief descriptions of the species of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon in birds of the sub-Saharan zone are included."
AVIAN HEMATOZOA FROM WEST-CENTRAL BOLIVIA,"A total of 641 birds representing 135 species of 25 families from Noel Kempff Mercado National Park in west-central Bolivia was examined for hematozoa; only 33 (5.1%) harbored blood parasites. Microfilariae were the most commonly encountered hematozoans, followed, in numerical sequence, by species of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium; Trypanosoma, Atoxoplasma, and Hepatozoon were seen infrequently. The survey included 13 new host-parasite records, and 58 species of birds were examined for blood parasites for the first time; 43 were parasite-free. The low prevalence of parasitism recorded in this survey is compared to other areas in the Neotropical region and to prevalence of blood parasites in the avifauna of other major land masses."
"Identification of bat trypanosomes from Minas Gerais state, Brazil, based on 18S rDNA and Cathepsin-L-like targets","Several bat species can be infected by trypanosomes, but there is not much information about which of these parasites infect bats from TriA cent ngulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, a formerly endemic region for Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The aim of this study was to describe, characterize, and identify the presence of trypanosomes in bats. The captured bats (448) belong to four families and to 19 different species. Of those, 37 bats were found to be positive for trypanosomes by microhematocrit, (infection rate 8.3%) and 27 were positive after hemoculture analysis. Initially, the isolates were identified by PCR (18S rDNA, 24S alpha rDNA, spliced leader, COII RFLP-PCR) using primers originally designed for T. cruzi. PCRs (18S rDNA, 24S alpha rDNA) showed compatible bands for TcI, whereas COII RFLP-PCR showed a similar pattern associated to TcII. However, there was no DNA amplification using spliced leader as a target, revealing a discrepancy between the results. Phylogenetic analysis of Cathepsin L-like and 18S rDNA sequences proved that 15 of the isolates corresponded to Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei and one to Trypanosoma dionisii. These results revealed that the diversity of trypanosome species in a region considered endemic for Chagas disease is greater than previous descriptions. All this can confirm the necessity of using DNA sequencing approaches in order to determinate trypanosomes species isolated from bats."
"Zoonotic Disease in a Peripheral Population: Persistence and Transmission of Leishmania major in a Putative Sink-Source System in the Negev Highlands, Israel","Populations at the edge of their geographic distributions are referred to as peripheral populations. Very little attention has been given to this topic in the context of persistence of infectious disease in natural populations. In this study, we examined this question using zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by Leishmania major in the Negev Desert of Israel as a model system. Here, we suggest that the regional persistence of Phlebotomus papatasi populations and L. major transmission in the Sede Boqer region could be explained through processes akin to sink-source and/or mainland-island metapopulation dynamics. Given its potentially enzootically superior ecological conditions, we hypothesize that the Zin Valley ecotope constitutes the ""mainland'' or the ""source'' patch for the Sede Boqer area where L. major transmission is persistent and resistant to local extinctions (die-outs) whereas the local sand fly populations on the Zin Plateau (""island patch'' or ""sink patch'') are more prone to local extinctions. Between 2007 and 2008, we trapped sand flies and sand rats in the two areas and compared sand fly abundance and L. major infection prevalence in both. In both 2007 and 2008, sand fly abundance was high and continuous in the Zin Wadi but low and discontinuous in the Zin Plateau. Infection prevalence of sand rats was significantly higher in the Wadi (13%) compared with the Zin Plateau (3%). Minimum infection rate in sand flies did not differ significantly between the two areas. Overall, our results are consistent with the premise that the Zin Valley population is relatively robust in terms of L. major transmission, whereas transmission is potentially more tenuous in the plateau. Understanding the biotic and abiotic processes enabling the persistence of L. major and other vector-borne diseases in peripheral disease foci is important for predicting the effect of anthropogenic land use and climate change."
Prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi in horses in Israel evaluated by serology and reverse dot blot,"Trypanosoma evansi is the cause of surra in horses, camels and other domestic animals. Following the first outbreak of surra in horses and camels in Israel in 2006, a survey of the prevalence of the parasite in the Israeli horse population was conducted using serology, PCR followed by the reverse dot blot (RDB) technique and blood smear microscopy. In total, 614 horses from 7 regions were sampled. The CATT/T. evansi kit was used for serology for all the horses. Horses from the Arava and Dead Sea region, where the first outbreak occurred, were sampled again one year later and both samples were subjected to serology and the RDB technique. The country wide seroprevalence was 4.6% (28/614). The seroprevalence in the Arava and Dead Sea region was 6.5% (9/139) in the first sampling compared with 4.1% (5/122) in the second, whereas the prevalence of RDB-positivity was 18.7% (26/139) in the first sampling and only 0.8% (1/122) in the second. All horses were asymptomatic except for one horse from the Arava and Dead Sea region that demonstrated clinical signs of surra combined with positive serology and RDB. The results of this study indicated that surra is prevalent in most regions of the country and thus should be considered an important differential diagnosis in horses and other domestic animals in Israel with chronic weight loss, edema or neurological signs.

Sexual differences in prevalence of a new species of trypanosome infecting tungara frogs,"Trypanosomes are a diverse group of protozoan parasites of vertebrates transmitted by a variety of hematophagous invertebrate vectors. Anuran trypanosomes and their vectors have received relatively little attention even though these parasites have been reported from frog and toad species worldwide. Blood samples collected from tungara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus), a Neotropical anuran species heavily preyed upon by eavesdropping frog-biting midges (Corethrella spp.), were examined for trypanosomes. Our results revealed sexual differences in trypanosome prevalence with female frogs being rarely infected (<1%). This finding suggests this protozoan parasite may be transmitted by frog-biting midges that find their host using the mating calls produced by male frogs. Following previous anuran trypanosome studies, we examined 18S ribosomal RNA gene to characterize and establish the phylogenetic relationship of the trypanosome species found in tungara frogs. A new species of giant trypanosome, Trypanosoma tungarae n. sp., is described in this study. Overall the morphometric data revealed that the trypomastigotes of T. tungarae n. sp. are similar to other giant trypanosomes such as Trypanosoma rotatorium and Trypanosoma ranarum. Despite its slender and long cell shape, however, 18S rRNA gene sequences revealed that T. tungarae n. sp. is sister to the rounded-bodied giant trypanosome, Trypanosoma chattoni. Therefore, morphological convergence explains similar morphology among members of two non-closely related groups of trypanosomes infecting frogs. The results from this study underscore the value of coupling morphological identification with molecular characterization of anuran trypanosomes. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Canine leishmaniasis: Identification of asymptomatic carriers by polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting,"A major limitation to the study of the epidemiology of canine visceral leishmaniasis is the inability to identify and count asymptomatic carriers because classic diagnostic tests are insufficiently sensitive. We investigated the capacity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the parasite and immunoblotting to detect specific antibodies in samples from dogs living in an endemic area without any symptoms of leishmaniasis. Results of classic serologic tests (immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were negative. Two independent PCR assays detected the parasite in skin and conjunctival samples from 80% of the dogs. We found specific antibodies by immunoblot in 66% and 56% of the dogs had both specific antibodies and parasite DNA. As controls, samples from dogs with clinical manifestations of the disease before and after treatment were assayed. The frequency of positive PCR samples decreased after treatment, and although antibody levels decreased with cure of the disease, they remained detectable by immunoblot. Results showed that most of the dogs living in an endemic area had been exposed to Leishmania. Both PCR and immunoblot are sensitive enough to detect asyptomatic infection and could be valuable tools for studies monitoring the transmission of the disease and vaccination trials."
Leishmania (L.) mexicana Infected Bats in Mexico: Novel Potential Reservoirs,"Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, an endemic zoonosis affecting a growing number of patients in the southeastern states of Mexico. Some foci are found in shade-grown cocoa and coffee plantations, or near perennial forests that provide rich breeding grounds for the sand fly vectors, but also harbor a variety of bat species that live off the abundant fruits provided by these shade-giving trees. The close proximity between sand flies and bats makes their interaction feasible, yet bats infected with Leishmania (L.) mexicana have not been reported. Here we analyzed 420 bats from six states of Mexico that had reported patients with leishmaniasis. Tissues of bats, including skin, heart, liver and/or spleen were screened by PCR for Leishmania (L.) mexicana DNA. We found that 41 bats (9.77%), belonging to 13 species, showed positive PCR results in various tissues. The infected tissues showed no evidence of macroscopic lesions. Of the infected bats, 12 species were frugivorous, insectivorous or nectarivorous, and only one species was sanguivorous (Desmodus rotundus), and most of them belonged to the family Phyllostomidae. The eco-region where most of the infected bats were caught is the Gulf Coastal Plain of Chiapas and Tabasco. Through experimental infections of two Tadarida brasiliensis bats in captivity, we show that this species can harbor viable, infective Leishmania (L.) mexicana parasites that are capable of infecting BALB/c mice. We conclude that various species of bats belonging to the family Phyllostomidae are possible reservoir hosts for Leishmania (L.) mexicana, if it can be shown that such bats are infective for the sand fly vector. Further studies are needed to determine how these bats become infected, how long the parasite remains viable inside these potential hosts and whether they are infective to sand flies to fully evaluate their impact on disease epidemiology."
Estimation of tsetse challenge and its relationship with trypanosomosis incidence in cattle kept under pastoral production systems in Kenya,
Prevalence and determinants of Leishmania major infection in emerging and old foci in Tunisia,"Background: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) due to Leishmania major (L. major) is still a serious public health problem in Tunisia. This study aimed to compare the prevalence and risk factors associated with L. major infection in old and new foci using leishmanin skin test (LST) in central Tunisia. Methods: A cross sectional household survey was carried out between January and May 2009 on a sample of 2686 healthy individuals aged between 5 and 65 years. We determined the prevalence of L. major infection using the LST. Risk factors of LST positivity were assessed using a logistic regression model. Results: The overall prevalence of LST positivity was 57% (95% CI: 53-59). The prevalence of L. major infection was significantly higher in the old focus (99%; 95% CI: 98-100) than in the emerging foci (43%; 95% CI: 39-46) (p = <0.001). Multivariate analysis of LST positivity risk factors showed that age, the nature of the foci (old/emerging), personal and family history of ZCL are determinants of positive LST results. Conclusion: The results updated the current epidemiologic profile of ZLC in central Tunisia. Past history of transmission in a population should be considered as a potential confounder in future clinical trials for drugs and vaccines against L. major cutaneous leishmaniasis."
"Triatoma brasiliensis Neiva, 1911: food sources and diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in wild and artificial environments of the semiarid region of Ceara, northeastern Brazil","BackgroundKnowledge of triatomine food sources in different ecotopes enables the estimation of T. cruzi transmission risk in diverse environments, as well as its dynamics of dispersion and ecological niche. For Triatoma brasiliensis in the Caatinga, in the northeast of Brazil, seasonal differences influence feeding eclecticism and rates of T. cruzi infection. The objective of the present study was to monitor food sources and to characterize the populations of T. cruzi associated with T. brasiliensis in wild and domestic environments in the Caatinga of northeast Brazil.MethodsA cross-sectional study based on a search for triatomines in wild and domestic environments, was undertaken at five different time periods from 2009 to 2015. Insects from 2015 were used for identification of food sources. Two universal primers, based on the conserved regions of the 12S rRNA locus, were used to amplify fragments of 215 bp. The content of the intestinal tract of triatomines was identified by a comparison between the sequences obtained and those deposited in the GenBank database, using BLAST. In triatomines with parasitological diagnosis of infection by trypanosomatids, xenoculture was performed for the isolation and characterization of strains, using cox2, the amplification of the SL-IL mini-exon intergenic spacer and the polymorphism of the D7 divergent domain of the gene 24rDNA-LSU.ResultsFood sources were identified in 76.3% (213/279) T. brasiliensis specimens sampled in 2015. The most frequent sources in a total of 20 vertebrate species were: rodents (58%, 123/213), ruminants (30%, 64/213) and cats (6%, 12/213). A total of 49% (44/89) of the samples of T. cruzi isolated in the period from 2009 to 2015 were characterized: TcII (43%, 19/44), TcI (41%, 18/44) and TcIII (16%, 7/44).ConclusionsThe feeding eclecticism of T. brasiliensis shows its importance in maintaining the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi, with evidence of intense circulation between anthropic and wild environments. Attention should be placed on the association among T. brasiliensis, rodents and ruminants, in addition to the presence of TcIII in the study region."
"Domestic, peridomestic and wild hosts in the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in the Caatinga area colonised by Triatoma brasiliensis","The role played by different mammal species in the maintenance of Trypanosoma cruzi is not constant and varies in time and place. This study aimed to characterise the importance of domestic, wild and peridomestic hosts in the transmission of T. cruzi in Taua, state of Ceara, Caatinga area, Brazil, with an emphasis on those environments colonised by Triatoma brasiliensis. Direct parasitological examinations were performed on insects and mammals, serologic tests were performed on household and outdoor mammals and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used on wild mammals. Cytochrome b was used as a food source for wild insects. The serum prevalence in dogs was 38% (20/53), while in pigs it was 6% (2/34). The percentages of the most abundantly infected wild animals were as follows: Thrichomys laurentius 74% (83/112) and Kerodon rupestris 10% (11/112). Of the 749 triatomines collected in the household research, 49.3% (369/749) were positive for T. brasiliensis, while 6.8% were infected with T. cruzi (25/369). In captured animals, T. brasiliensis shares a natural environment with T. laurentius, K. rupestris, Didelphis albiventris, Monodelphis domestica, Galea spixii, Wiedomys pyrrhorhinos, Conepatus semistriatus and Mus musculus. In animals identified via their food source, T. brasiliensis shares a natural environment with G. spixii, K. rupestris, Capra hircus, Gallus gallus, Tropidurus oreadicus and Tupinambis merianae. The high prevalence of T. cruzi in household and peridomiciliar animals reinforces the narrow relationship between the enzootic cycle and humans in environments with T. brasiliensis and characterises it as ubiquitous."
Natural infection of Phlebotomus argentipes with Leishmania and other trypanosomatids in a visceral leishmaniasis endemic region of Nepal,"Monitoring Leishmania infection in sand flies is important for understanding the eco-epidemiology of kala-azar and assessing the impact of the recently launched kala-azar control programme in the Indian subcontinent. We applied a PCR technique that targets rRNA genes to estimate the natural incidence of Leishmania infection in sand flies sampled in six villages of the Terai region of Nepal. Amplifications were made on 135 pools of sand flies and confirmed by sequencing. Seven pools were found to be PCR positive: in five of them we identified the rDNA signature found in Leishmania spp., whereas two other pools revealed a sequence compatible with other trypanosomatids. Different methodologies were applied to evaluate the infection rate from pools of unequal size and estimated the infection rate to range from 0.468% to 0.578% for the Leishmania group and from 0.185% to 0.279% for the non-Leishmania group. Our results highlight the diversity of flagellate infections likely to be encountered in Phlebotomus argentipes populations. Our methodology allows clear discrimination of Leishmania from other trypanosomatids and should be applied on larger insect samples or in longitudinal studies.

"Domestic Animals and Epidemiology of Visceral Leishmaniasis, Nepal","On the Indian subcontinent, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is considered an anthroponosis. To determine possible reasons for its persistence during interepidemic periods, we mapped Leishmania infections among healthy persons and animals in an area of active VL transmission in Nepal. During 4 months (September 2007-February 2008), blood was collected from persons, goats, cows, and buffaloes in 1 village. Leishmania infections were determined by using PCR. We found infections among persons (6.1%), cows (5%), buffaloes (4%), and goats (16%). Data were georeferenced and entered into a geographic information system. The bivariate K-function results indicated spatial clustering of Leishmania spp.-positive persons and domestic animals. Classification tree analysis determined that among several possible risk factors for Leishmania infection among persons, proximity of Leishmania spp.-positive goats ranked first. Although our data do not necessarily mean that goats constitute a reservoir host of L. donovani, these observations indicate the need for further investigation of goats' possible role in VL transmission."
"Field Investigation on the Prevalence of Trypanosomiasis in Camels in Relation to Sex, Age, Breed and Herd Size","Blood samples were collected from 240 camels (183 male and 57 female) of four breeds from six districts of Sindh. An overall infection was determined as 11.25%. Species of Trypanosoma was identified as Trypanosoma evansi. District wise infection was found to be 2.5, 7.5, 12.5, 15.00, 22.5 and 7.5% in Hyderabad, Mirpur Khas, Umerkot, Badin, Thatta and Larkana, respectively. A higher infection was found in females (15.79%) as compared to males (9.84%). Highest (14.96%) infection was noted in age group > 7 years, followed by 8.57 and 4.65% in 3 to 7 years and less than to 3 years old camels, respectively. Four breeds of camels were surveyed and the highest infection rate was found in Sakrai breed (21.82%), followed by 16.67, 6.15 and 5.95% in Kharai, Sindhi and Dhati breeds respectively. When herd size was considered, infection rate was 1.67, 6.67, 15.00 and 21.67% in herds possessing 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 20 and more than 20 animals, respectively. (c) 2010 PVJ. All rights reserved"
"Diagnosis of Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi infection in dogs and the relationship with environmental and sanitary aspects in the municipality of Palmas, state of Tocantins, Brazil","Introduction: The aim of the present study was to identify the presence of Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi infection in dogs in the city of Palmas, Tocantins, Brazil, using the PCR technique to list the hot spots of infected dogs in the city and associate their occurrence to significant environmental changes at capture sites. Methods: DNA was extracted from blood of dogs, and the PCR were performed with primers RV1/RV2. After screening the population studied, the regions of the city that had the highest occurrence of canine infection were detected. These sites were visited, and ecological parameters denoting anthropogenic disturbance were evaluated. Results: Some important features were listed in the regions visited, such as low urbanization, lack of public collection of sewage, limited garbage collection, vacant lots with tall vegetation, decaying organic matter, and, most importantly, the occurrence of stray dogs and poultry in homes. Conclusions: The methodology for screening the population was very efficient, especially in evaluating a large number of individuals in a short time, with a high degree of automation. The results indicate an association between the observed parameters and the occurrence of infection in dogs. The model presented in the city is ideal for studies of disease progression and expansion and for the evaluation of control measures adopted for canine VL."
"Prevalence of leishmaniosis in dogs in Istanbul, Turkey determined by using PCR","Leishmania infantum is widespread in Mediterranean countries including Turkey and can cause a serious disease in both humans and dogs. Dogs are considered to be its main reservoirs. The current epidemiological study was carried out in Istanbul for detection of leishmaniosis among dogs. A total of 246 dogs were included in the study. Twenty one (8.54%) blood samples were found to be positive based on PCR diagnosis, using primers specific for the kinetoplast DNA of Leishmania. Infection rate was 6.51% in 169 dogs living in shelters and 12.99% in 77 client-owned dogs. The rate was significantly (p<0.001) higher in the dogs (37.93%) presenting one or more clinical symptoms which may be attributable to leishmaniosis, than in the asymptomatic dogs (4.61%). Eleven (52.4%) of 21 PCR positive dogs presented clinical symptoms whereas the rest of the dogs (47.62%) were asymptomatic. The major clinical sign in PCR positive animals was dermatological problems. Amongst PCR positive dogs, skin lesions were present in 11, weight loss in 2, lymphadenopathy in 2, epistaxis in 2 and lethargy in 2 dogs."
"Epidemiology of Trypanosoma evansi and Trypanosoma vivax in domestic animals from selected districts of Tigray and Afar regions, Northern Ethiopia","Background: African animal trypanosomosis, transmitted cyclically by tsetse flies or mechanically by other biting flies, causes serious inflictions to livestock health. This study investigates the extent of non-tsetse transmitted animal trypanosomosis (NTTAT) by Trypanosoma (T.) evansi and T. vivax in domestic animals in the tsetse-free regions of Northern Ethiopia, Afar and Tigray. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on 754 dromedary camels, 493 cattle, 264 goats, 181 sheep, 84 donkeys, 25 horses and 10 mules. The microhaematocrit centrifugation technique was used as parasitological test. Plasma was collected for serodiagnosis with CATT/T.evansi and RoTat 1.2 immune trypanolysis (ITL) while buffy coat specimens were collected for molecular diagnosis with T. evansi type A specific RoTat 1.2 PCR, T. evansi type B specific EVAB PCR and T. vivax specific TvPRAC PCR. Results: The parasitological prevalence was 4.7% in Tigray and 2.7% in Afar and significantly higher (z = 2.53, p = 0.011) in cattle (7.3%) than in the other hosts. Seroprevalence in CATT/T.evansi was 24.6% in Tigray and 13.9% in Afar and was significantly higher (z = 9.39, p < 0.001) in cattle (37.3%) than in the other hosts. On the other hand, seroprevalence assessed by ITL was only 1.9% suggesting cross reaction of CATT/T.evansi with T. vivax or other trypanosome infections. Molecular prevalence of T. evansi type A was 8.0% in Tigray and in Afar and varied from 28.0% in horses to 2.2% in sheep. It was also significantly higher (p < 0.001) in camel (11.7%) than in cattle (6.1%), donkey (6%), goat (3.8%), and sheep (2.2%). Four camels were positive for T. evansi type B. Molecular prevalence of T. vivax was 3.0% and was similar in Tigray and Afar. It didn't differ significantly among the host species except that it was not detected in horses and mules. Conclusions: NTTAT caused by T. vivax and T. evansi, is an important threat to animal health in Tigray and Afar. For the first time, we confirm the presence of T. evansi type B in Ethiopian camels. Unexplained results obtained with the current diagnostic tests in bovines warrant particular efforts to isolate and characterise trypanosome strains that circulate in Northern Ethiopia."
"Livestock trypanosomosis in Uganda: parasite heterogeneity and anaemia status of naturally infected cattle, goats and pigs","The prevalence and pathogenic effects of trypanosomosis were determined in cattle, goats and pigs reared in Kasese, Jinja and Rakai districts, Uganda; presence of trypanosomes was detected by buffy coat technique (BCT). The overall prevalence of trypanosomosis in cattle was 7.6 % (144/1,891), 0.7 % in goats (4/573) and 2.3 % in pigs (9/386). Internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) of ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction was utilised to identify trypanosomes to species level and revealed infections in 108 of the 144 trypanosome-positive cattle while all infected goats and pigs gave amplicons. Trypanosoma vivax was the most prevalent trypanosome species in cattle in single and mixed infections compared to infections involving Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma brucei; in pigs, eight were mixed infections with one single T. vivax infection. No predominant trypanosome species was detected in goats. Anaemia, the main trypanosomosis pathological feature, was investigated by determining packed cell volume (PCV). Mean PCV values by t test in infected individuals were significantly lower than non-infected individuals (P < 0.05) for all animal species. However, the proportion of anaemic animals was not significantly different in infected and non-infected individuals. In addition, the percent of infected animals by Fisher's exact test depended on district of origin and species but not sex. These findings show that trypanosomosis is a major cause of anaemia in livestock in endemic areas. Cattle were the major animal species affected by trypanosomosis; similar genotypes of trypanosomes were detected in the three animal species. BCT was more effective than ITS1 rDNA detecting trypanosomes in naturally infected cattle."
"Cost-Effective Analysis of Control Strategies to Reduce the Prevalence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, Based on a Mathematical Model","Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical vector-borne epidemic disease, and its transmission is a complex process. Zoonotic transmission to humans or animals occurs through the bites of female Phlebotominae sand flies. Here, reservoir is considered as a major source of endemic pathogen pool for disease outbreak, and the role of more than one reservoir animal becomes indispensable. To study the role of the reservoir animals on disease dynamics, a mathematical model was constructed consisting of susceptible and infected populations of humans and two types of reservoir (animal) and vector populations, respectively. Our aim is to prevent the disease by applying a control theoretic approach, when more than one type of reservoir animal exists in the region. We use drugs like sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate to control the disease for humans and spray insecticide to control the sand fly population. Similarly, drugs are applied for infected reservoir animals of Types A and B. We calculated the cost-effectiveness of all possible combinations of the intervention and control policies. One of our findings is that the most cost-effective case for Leishmania control is the spray of insecticides for infected sand fly vector. Alternate strategic cases were compared to address the critical shortcomings of single strategic cases, and a range of control strategies were estimated for effective control and economical benefit of the overall control strategy. Our findings provide the most innovative techniques available for application to the successful eradication of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the future."
"Prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in selected areas of Jabi Tehenan district, West Gojam of Amhara regional state, Northwestern Ethiopia","Cross sectional study was conducted in Jabi Tehenan district of West Gojjam administrative zone from October 2008 to April 2009 to determine the current prevalence rate of bovine trypanosomosis. In the parasitological survey, blood samples of 300 cattle were examined using a buffy coat technique. The PCV value of each animal was also measured using hematocrit reader. The overall prevalence of trypanosomosis was found to be 11.7% and it consists of 16, 10 and 9% in Regeb Kebero Meda, Weyenema Workema and around Finote Selam peasant associations respectively. The most positive cases were due to Trypanosoma congolense (54.3%) followed by Trypanosoma vivax (45.7%). The mean PCV value (%) of parasitaemic and aparasitaemic animals during the study period were 20.3+/-4.1 SD and 25.29+/-4.67 SD with a significance difference (p < 0.05). The study also demonstrated variations prevalent among different age groups and between both sexes which were statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). Infection rate in poor body condition animals were significantly higher than good body condition animals (p < 0.05). The present prevalent study generated valuable information on the epidemiology of bovine trypanosomosis in the study area and revealed that trypanosomosis is an important disease in the study area."
Survey for Canine Leishmaniosis,"Leishmania parasites cause a group of diseases collectively known as Leishmaniasis For a long time dogs have been implicated as the main domestic reservoirs of Leishmania infantum, the aetiological agent of zoonotic visceral Leishmaniasis There are the same data about canine Leishmaniasis m other Mediterranean countries The study investigates the level of prevalence into important areas m South Albania Serologic methods are considered as the most efficient methods for the early diagnosis of Leishmaniasis ELISA test is necessary to make the final serological diagnosis of most frequently parasitic diseases of dogs The use of serological methods determinate in accurate and rapid way the diagnosis of Leishmaniasis infection Cross-sectional investigation was done on seroprevalence of Leishmania sp infection among apparently healthy dogs m an area where canine Leishmaniasis is endemic Each dog was clinically examined for the presence of some discrete signs compatible with Leishmaniasis The seroprevalence at the nonendemic area resulted 106% A few of the seropositive dogs had moderately enlarged lymph nodes and some clinical signs Trombocythopepia in animals with clinical signs can be used as a first indicator for leishmania diagnosis."
Evidence of Leishmania spp. antibodies and DNA in dogs in the Middle Black Sea Region of Turkey,"The World Health Organization considers leishmaniasis to be one of the most important zoonotic diseases with approximately 350 million people in 98 countries at risk of contracting the disease. The leishmaniasis also remains a severe public health problem in Turkey. It is important to evaluate the prevalence of Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) for designing control policies. In the present study, we report for the first time the occurrence of Leishmania infection in dogs living in the Middle Black Sea Region of Turkey. For the diagnosis of the infection parasitological (direct microscopic examination of lymph nodes), serological (ELISA) and molecular (kDNA-PCR) methods were performed using blood samples obtained from 240 dogs. Sand flies were also collected using CDC miniature light traps from the same locations for testing Leishmania presence by kDNA-PCR. Only one (0.41%) dog out of 240 was found to be positive by both tests. Amastigotes of Leishmania spp. were detected in the same animal lymph node aspirate sample. A total of 18 sand flies were collected and no Leishmania was detected Phlebotomus spp. sample pool. Our results showed that CanL could have public health implications and future screening studies are needed in this region of Turkey."
Seroprevalence for Trypanosoma cruzi infection and associated factors in an endemic area of Venezuela,"This study investigated risk factors associated with positive serological status for Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in 26 rural communities including 905 households, 2,156 humans, and 333 dogs in Lara State, Venezuela. Serology was performed with ELISA and MABA. Data were obtained from entomological, demographic, and clinical surveys. Risk factors were determined through binary logistic regression. Seroprevalence was 7.24% in humans and 6.9% in canines. Positive serological status was positively associated with the Rhodnius prolixus vector, age, maternal history of Chagas disease, tobacco chewing, presence of mammals and birds in the household, household disarray, mud-and-wattle outbuildings, and animal nests and burrows in the peridomicile, and negatively associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption, history of cancer, and storage deposits in the peridomile. In conclusion, Chagas disease in this rural area is an old phenomenon transmitted by R. prolixus or by the transplacental route, associated with socio-cultural habits related to poverty, sylvatic surroundings, and the host's medical history."
"Prevalence and spatial distribution of visceral leishmaniasis in dogs Juatuba, Minas Gerais, Brazil","The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of visceral leishmaniasis in dogs (VLD) at Juatuba city, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 2010. A cross-sectional observational study was performed collecting blood samples from 957 dogs, defined randomly in all city districts. For the sorological diagnosis was used indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), recommended by the Ministry of Health. Geographical coordinates of properties that participated in the survey were marked in order to check the spatial distribution of canine cases. The VLD prevalence was estimated in 10.6%, ranging from 3% to 50.0%, distributed between 70.6% of city districts. Spatial distribution could be observed by scanning the clusters and according to the disease occurrences the demarcation of different risk areas could be obtained. There was an increase of 2.80 times more likely to acquire the VLD on the primary cluster. As of this research the prevention and control actions for VLD were made according to the specificity of each location to prevent the disease spread among dogs and new human cases."

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY ON HAEMOPARASITES OF DROMEDARY (Camelus dromedarius) IN IRAN,"This research was conducted to determine the prevalence and seasonal fluctuation of haemoparasites in dromedaries in the eastern part of Iran. Blood samples of 262 dromedaries in abattoir of Mashhad, from May 2008 to June 2009 were analysed for haemoprotozoa by smear examination of blood stained with Giemsa's stain. The same samples were also examined by knott technique for detection of camel filariasis. Dromedaries were infected with Dipetalonema evansi (5.34%) and Trypanosoma evansi (0.58%), respectively. No infection with Theileria and Anaplasma were found. The prevalence rate of infection with Dipetalonema evansi was highest in autumn in female dromedaries aged 4-8 year. However, there was no significant relation between infection, age, sex and season. In the second study, inspection of testes, epididymis, spermatic cord and lungs of 172 dromedaries revealed that 10 (5.81%) dromedaries were infected with adult forms of Dipetalonema evansi. Male nematode was measured to be 9.5-10.5 cm, female nematode 17.5-19.5 cm and microfilariae 260-360 micrometer. Dromedaries in eastern part of Iran usually suffer from low grade infections with Dipetalonema evansi."

Field assessment of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and host survival in the native rodent Octodon degus,"Chagas disease is a zoonosis caused by the flagellated parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by triatomine insects to several mammalian species acting as reservoir hosts. In the present study, we assess T. cruzi-prevalence, survivorship and T. cruzi-infection rate of the endemic rodent Octodon degus from a hyper-endemic area of Chagas disease in Chile. Parasite detection is performed by PCR assays on blood samples of individuals captured in austral summer of 2010, and on non-infected individuals recaptured in 2011 as well as on new captures. Results show a high infection level in this species (up to 70%). Infected O. degus have the same chance of surviving to the next reproductive season as uninfected individuals, irrespective of sex. We suggest that O. degus, an abundant long-lived rodent with high dispersal capability, could be considered an important native reservoir of T. cruzi in the wild transmission cycle of Chagas disease in Chile.

Temporal variation in Trypanosoma cruzi lineages from the native rodent Octodon degus in semiarid Chile,"Chagas disease is a zoonosis caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosome cruzi and transmitted by triatomine insects to several mammalian species acting as reservoir hosts. In the present study, we assess T. cruzi-prevalence and DTU composition of the endemic rodent Octodon degus from a hyper-endemic area of Chagas disease in Chile. Parasite detection is performed by PCR assays on blood samples of individuals captured in the austral summers of 2010-2013. The infection level in rodents differed in the summers of these four years between 18% and 70%. Overall, infected O. degus showed similar T. cruzi-DTU composition (TcI,TcII, TcV and TcVI lineages) among years, corresponding to single and mixed infection, but the relative importance of each DTU changed among years. In 2013, we detected that only three out of the four T. cruzi-DTU found in O. degas were present in the endemic triatomine Mepria spinolai. We suggest that O. degus, an abundant long-lived rodent, is an important native reservoir of T. cruzi in the wild transmission cycle of Chagas disease and it is able to maintain all the T. cruzi-DTUs described in semiarid Chile.

Epidemiological investigations on Trypanosoma evansi infection in dromedary camels in the South of Algeria,"An epidemiological study of Trypanosoma evansi (T. evansi) infection in dromedaries was conducted in four wilayate (localities) of Southern Algeria: Bechar, El Bayadh, Ouargla, Tamanrasset. Between February 2014 and April 2016, 1056 camels of different ages and both sexes from 84 herds were sampled. The prevalence was determined through parasitological examination (Giemsa stained thin smear, GST), serological tests (CATT/T. evansi, ELISA/VSG RoTat 1.2, immune trypanolysis), and molecular tests (T. evansi type A specific RoTat 1.2 PCR and T. evansi type B specific EVAB PCR). The overall prevalence was 2.4 % with GST, 32.4% with CATT/T. evansi, 23.1% with ELISA/VSG RoTat 1.2, 21.0% with immune trypanolysis (TL), 11.2 % with RoTat 1.2 PCR and 0% with EVAB PCR. El Bayadh was the most affected wilaya with 11.8% positives in GST, 74.9% in CATT/T. evansi, 70.1% in ELISA/VSG RoTat 1.2 and 62.2% in immune trypanolysis. Only in Bechar, a non-significantly higher prevalence (13.6%) was observed with RoTat1.2 PCR than in El Bayadh (13.0%). We didn't find any evidence of the presence of T. evansi type B in the study area."
Anti-nucleus antibodies detection by line immunoassay. Correlation with indirect immunofluorescence,"The most used screening test to detect autoantibodies in systemic diseases is indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) with Hep-2 cells. However additional methods, such as double diffusion, immunoblotting, ELISA or line immunoassay (LIA), are used to identify specific antibodies profiles. The aim of this study was: a) To asses the probability of fine detection by a commercial LIA on serum samples that resulted positive by IIF screening and b) To asses the correlation between the patterns and titles observed. A hundred and sixty-one serum samples positive by IIF that had also been processed by LIA were selected. Hep-2 slides of Kallestad and commercial kit Innolia-ANA of Innogenetics were used. Sixty samples were also studied for anti-dsDNA by IIF with Crithidia Lucilliae slides of Kallestad. Sixty per cent of the samples with homogeneus pattern were positive by LIA, with a prevalence of anti-histones and anti-dsDNA. The finding of antibodies anti-ENA in this group was important. In the speckle sample, 73% were positive. In detecting anti-ENA, speckle sample was more forceful than homogeneous pattern which showed little information about a specific antibodies profile. Anticentromere pattern did not need confirmation. The probability of finding fine reactivity by LIA is increased with the rise in title, but its search for low titles is still justified."
Prevalence of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) among dogs in Oklahoma,"Objective-To determine the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection among dogs in Oklahoma. Design-Cross-sectional study. Animals-301 owned or impounded dogs related by ownership or general geographic location to 3 dogs determined to have trypanosomiasis. Procedures-Blood samples were obtained from dogs between November 1996 and September 1997. Infection status was determined by use of a radioimmunoprecipitation assay. Second blood samples were obtained from some of the seropositive dogs for study by hemoculture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Sites where infected dogs were found were inspected for triatomine insects, and light traps were used for vector trapping. Results-11 (3.6%) dogs were seropositive for T cruzi infection. Ten of the 11 were owned rural hunting dogs. Protozoal organisms isolated from the blood of 1 seropositive dog were identified as T cruzi by PCR testing. Only 1 adult Triatoma sanguisuga was captured in a light trap at a site near infected dogs; this insect was not infected. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Our findings suggest that 7 cruzi is enzootic in eastern Oklahoma. Measures that would reduce the risk of dogs acquiring 7 cruzi infection are unlikely to be acceptable to their owners, and no effective drugs are available for treatment. The presence of 7 cruzi-infected dogs poses a threat of transmission to persons at risk of exposure to contaminated blood Veterinarians who practice in the southern United States should be cognizant of this blood borne zoonosis and educate all personnel about appropriate precautions."
Coinfection by Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania spp. in domestic cats (Felis catus) in State of Mato Grosso do Sul,"Introduction: Leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis are important to public health. Methods: Antibodies for Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania spp. were evaluated in cats from Campo Grande, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, a region endemic for canine visceral leishmaniasis. Serum samples from 50 asymptomatic cats were titrated for T. gondii by the immunofluorescence antibody test and modified agglutination test and for Leishmania spp. by the immunofluorescence antibody test. Results: These two agents coinfected two (4%) of the 50 tested animals. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the concomitant presence of two important zoonoses in cats from Brazilian endemic regions for canine visceral leishmaniasis."
"CANINE LEISHMANIASIS IN THE GARGANO PROMONTORY (APULIA, SOUTH ITALY)","We examined 444 dogs by visiting farms and peripheral districts on the Gargano promontory (Province of Foggia, Apulia, South Italy). Clinical examination and immunofluorescence antibody test for leishmaniasis were performed. Bone marrow and lymph node samples obtained from 25 dogs with positive serological test were cultured on Tobie-Evans medium. The results obtained show both a higher seropositivity rate for canine leishmaniasis (14.4%) and a higher percentage of asymptomatic dogs with positive serological test (53.1%) compared to previous research in the same area. Seven strains isolated from infected dogs belonged to Leishmania infantum species zymodeme Montpellier 1. None of 82 sera of humans living in close contact with infected dogs were positive for leishmaniasis."
"Prevalence and risk factors associated with Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi infections in dogs presented at veterinary clinics in Joao Pessoa, Paraiba state, northeastern Brazil","This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with Leishmania spp. and Trl.panosoma cruzi infections in dogs presented at veterinary clinics in the city of JoAo Pessoa, Paraiba state, northeastern Brazil. A total of 384 dogs from 34 veterinary clinics were sampled between April 2015 and May 2016. For serological diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, the indirect fluorescent antibody test was used. Reactive sera were submitted to a confirmatory test using the S7 ELISA. The seroprevalence of Leishmania spp. was 2.8% (11/384), and that of T. cruzi was 1.5% (6/384). Two animals were positive for both parasites. The variable ""access to the street"" was identified as a risk factor for Leishmania spp. infection (OR = 4.81; 95% CI = 1.23-18.75). We concluded that a significant proportion of dogs presented at veterinary clinics in Joao Pessoa are seropositive for Leishmania spp. or T cruzi infections, and we suggest that greater care be taken with dogs that have access to the street."
Detection of Leishmania DNA and blood meal sources in phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in western of Spain: Update on distribution and risk factors associated,"Leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is present in Mediterranean countries, with high prevalence in areas of the center and south of Spain. However, in some regions such as Extremadura (in southwest of Spain), data has not been updated since 1997. The aim of this work was (i) to provide information about the distribution of phlebotomine sand fly species in western of Spain (Extremadura region), (ii) to determine risk factors for the presence of sand fly vectors and (iii) to detect Leishmania DNA and identify blood meal sources in wild caught females. During 2012-2013, sand flies were surveyed using CDC miniature light-traps in 13 of 20 counties in Extremadura. Specimens were identified morphologically and females were used for molecular detection of Leishmania DNA by kDNA, ITS-I and cyt-B. In addition, blood meals origins were analyzed by a PCR based in vertebrate cyt b gene. A total of 1083 sand flies of both gender were captured and identified. Five species were collected, Phlebotomus perniciosus (60.76%), Sergentomyia minuta (29.92%), P. ariasi (7.11%), P. papatasi (1.48%) and P. sergenti (0.74%). The last three species constitute the first report in Badajoz, the most southern province of Extremadura region. Leishmania DNA was detected in three out of 435 females (one P. pernicious and two S. minuta). Characterization of obtained DNA sequences by phylogenetic analyses revealed close relatedness with Leishmania tarentolae in S. minuta and L infantum in P. perniciosus. Haematic preferences showed a wide range of hosts, namely: swine, humans, sheep, rabbits, horses, donkeys and turkeys. The simultaneous presence of P. perniciosus and P. ariasi vectors, the analysis of blood meals, together with the detection of L infantum and in S. minuta of L. tarentolae, confirms the ideal conditions for the transmission of this parasitosis in the western of Spain. These results improve the epidemiological knowledge of leishmaniosis and its vectors in this part of Spain, highlighting the need for ongoing entomological and parasitological surveillance.

Haemoparasites of common shrews (Sorex araneus) in Northwest England,"The presence of haemoparasites belonging to the taxa Anaplasma, Bartonella and Trypanosoma was determined among 76 common shrews (Sorex araneus) from Northwest England. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was recovered from the blood of 1 shrew (1-3%), with the amplified 16S rRNA A sequence identical to one previously reported from a bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). Trypanosoma spp. DNA was detected in 9 shrews (11.8%), the amplified 18S rDNA fragments being indistinguishable from one another, and distinct from previously published data. This represents the first report of trypanosome infection in S. araneus and suggests they are susceptible to an uncharacterized Trypanosoma species. Blood from 11 shrews (14.5%) yielded Bartonella spp., with characterization of isolates using comparative sequence analysis of partial gltA and 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer regions revealing 2 different genotypes. Phylogenetic inference from alignment of partial gltA sequences found that both UK S. araneus types formed a well-supported cluster with Bartonella sp. isolated from S. araneus in Sweden. No significant effect of host age, sex, or year of collection was found on prevalence of Bartonella or trypanosome infections. The results of this survey demonstrate that common shrews in the UK are susceptible to haemoparasitic infections, at prevalences similar to those reported from sympatric rodents."
Genetic Characterization of Trypanosoma cruzi DTUs in Wild Triatoma infestans from Bolivia: Predominance of TcI,"Background: The current persistence of Triatoma infestans (one of the main vectors of Chagas disease) in some domestic areas could be related to re-colonization by wild populations which are increasingly reported. However, the infection rate and the genetic characterization of the Trypanosoma cruzi strains infecting these populations are very limited. Methodology/Principal Findings: Of 333 wild Triatoma infestans specimens collected from north to south of a Chagas disease endemic area in Bolivia, we characterized 234 stocks of Trypanosoma cruzi using mini-exon multiplex PCR (MMPCR) and sequencing the glucose phosphate isomerase (Gpi) gene. Of the six genetic lineages (""discrete typing units""; DTU) (TcI-VI) presently recognized in T. cruzi, TcI (99.1%) was overdominant on TcIII (0.9%) in wild Andean T. infestans, which presented a 71.7% infection rate as evaluated by microscopy. In the lowlands (Bolivian Chaco), 17 ""dark morph"" T. infestans were analyzed. None of them were positive for parasites after microscopic examination, although one TcI stock and one TcII stock were identified using MMPCR and sequencing. Conclusions/Significance: By exploring large-scale DTUs that infect the wild populations of T. infestans, this study opens the discussion on the origin of TcI and TcV DTUs that are predominant in domestic Bolivian cycles."
"American tripanosomiasis: a study on the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma cruzi-like organisms in wild rodents in San Luis province, Argentina","Introduction: Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Wild and perianthropic mammals maintain the infection/transmission cycle, both in their natural habitat and in the peridomestic area. The aim of this paper was to present the results from a study on wild rodents in the central and northern regions of San Luis province, Argentina, in order to evaluate the prevalence of this infection. Methods: Sherman traps were set up in capture areas located between latitudes 32 degrees and 33 degrees S, and longitudes 65 degrees and 66 degrees W. The captured rodents were taxonomically identified and hemoflagellates were isolated. Morphological, biometric and molecular studies and in vitro cultures were performed. Infection of laboratory animals and histological examination of the cardiac muscle and inoculation area were also carried out. Parasites were detected in circulating blood in Calomys musculinus, Graomys griseoflavus, Phyllotis darwini and Akodon molinae. The parasites were identified using biological criteria. Molecular PCR studies were performed on some isolates, which confirmed the characterization of these hemoflagellates as Trypanosoma cruzi. Results and Conclusions: Forty-four percent of the 25 isolates were identified as Trypanosoma cruzi, and the remaining 56% as Trypanosoma cruzi-like. These findings provide evidence that wild rats infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma cruzi-like organisms are important in areas of low endemicity."
Canine visceral leishmaniasis in the Northeast Region of Brazil,"Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonosis that affects dogs and other mammals, including humans. Contact with dogs is a major risk factor for humans. This disease is endemic in several regions of Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Leishmania spp. infection in dogs and to correlate it with possible risk factors. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 391 dogs of different ages, breeds, and both genders, coming from Campina Grande, Paraiba state, Brazil. An epidemiological questionnaire was employed in order to identify risk factors associated with the disease. Serological tests were performed using indirect immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA S7 (R)) and polymerase chain reaction. Results: Leishmania spp. antibodies were detected in 33 (8.4 %) and 17 (4.3 %) dogs according to the indirect immunofluorescence test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA S7 (R)), respectively. PCR results indicated the presence of L. chagasi DNA in only eight (2 %) blood samples. There was a significant association between reactive animals and contact with animals from different houses (OR = 4.1; p = 0.02). Conclusions: It is suggested that CVL may occur in urban areas. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the association among different diagnostic tests may lead to a more accurate identification of positive animals, which might help to improve the disease control and prevent euthanasia in false-positive results."
Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi Among Eleven Potential Reservoir Species from Six States Across the Southern United States,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, is a substantial public health concern in Latin America. Although rare in humans and domestic animals in the United States, T. cruzi is commonly detected in some wildlife species, most commonly raccoons (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana). To increase our understanding of the reservoir host species range and geographic distribution, 11 species of mammals from six states spanning the known range of T. cruzi (Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Virginia) were tested for antibodies to T. cruzi using indirect immunofluorescent antibody testing. In addition, culture isolation attempts were conducted on a limited number of animals from Georgia and Florida. Evidence of T. cruzi was found in every state except California; however, low numbers of known reservoirs were tested in California. In general, the highest seroprevalence rates were found in raccoons (0-68%) and opossums (17-52%), but antibodies to T. cruzi were also detected in small numbers of striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) from Arizona and Georgia, bobcats (Lynx rufus) from Georgia, two coyotes (Canis latrans) from Georgia and Virginia, and a ringtail (Bassariscus astutus) from Arizona. Culture-based prevalence rates for raccoons were significantly greater than those for opossums; however, seroprevalences of raccoons and opossums from several geographic locations in Georgia and Florida were not different, indicating that exposure rates of these two species are similar within these areas. For both raccoons and opossums, seroprevalence was significantly higher in females than in males. No difference was detected in seroprevalence between adults and juveniles and between animals caught in urban and rural locations. Our results indicate that T. cruzi prevalence varies by host species, host characteristics, and geographic region and provides data to guide future studies on the natural history of T. cruzi in the United States."
"Epidemiological study of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Saesie Tsaeda-emba district, eastern Tigray, northern Ethiopia","Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is one of the endemic and neglected diseases known to exist in Ethiopian highlands. However, little is known about its epidemiological characteristics. Hence, this study was initiated and conducted from November 2011 to April 2012 to assess the epidemiological situation of CL in Saesie Tsaeda-emba District. Methods: A cross sectional design was employed in six randomly selected Peasant associations and a house to house survey was carried out in the District. Detailed clinical assessment, and smear and culture for Leishmania parasite detection were done to confirm clinical suspension. Polymerase Chain Reaction and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the ribosomal DNA Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS-1) sequences was used to type isolates. Sandfly collection was also conducted in possible micro-habitats of the target areas. Results: The overall prevalence of CL in the District was 14.0% (6.7% for active lesion and 7.3% for scar) with the highest prevalence amongst the age group of 10-19 years. Field isolates typed were L. aethiopica. Environmental and host risk factors significantly associated with CL distribution were age, study Peasant associations, presence of cave/gorge, walls with cracks and/or holes, presence of hyrax, animal burrow, animal dung and farm land near to residents' houses. Five phlebotomine sandflies, Phlebotomus longipes, Sergentomyia bedfordi, S. africana, S. schwetzi and S. antenata were captured. Conclusion: All the precipitating factors in the area are indicative of the public health importance of CL although there has been little attention given. The present study is a starter for wider investigation into the mode of its transmission, incrimination of sandfly vectors and possible animal reservoirs. Detailed information will be the basis to launch effective control of CL in the area."
Colony pace: a life-history trait affecting social insect epidemiology,"Among colonies of social insects, the worker turnover rate (colony 'pace') typically shows considerable variation. This has epidemiological consequences for parasites, because in 'fast-paced' colonies, with short-lived workers, the time of parasite residence in a given host will be reduced, and further transmission may thus get less likely. Here, we test this idea and ask whether pace is a life-history strategy against infectious parasites. We infected bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) with the infectious gut parasite Crithidia bombi, and experimentally manipulated birth and death rates to mimic slow and fast pace. We found that fewer workers and, importantly, fewer last-generation workers that are responsible for rearing sexuals were infected in colonies with faster pace. This translates into increased fitness in fast-paced colonies, as daughter queens exposed to fewer infected workers in the nest are less likely to become infected themselves, and have a higher chance of founding their own colonies in the next year. High worker turnover rate can thus act as a strategy of defence against a spreading infection in social insect colonies."
Epidemiological study of honeybee pathogens in Europe: The results of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain),"As a part of a Pilot Monitoring Program of honey bee health coordinated by the EURL (European Union Reference Laboratory) and according to the criteria established for Spain, 14 apiaries in Castilla-La Mancha were selected at random and sampled during the autumns of 2012-2014 to identify the most prevalent nosogenic agents, potentially those related to the honey bee colony collapse phenomenon. In all the apiaries studied, Nosema ceranae was the most prevalent pathogen detected over the three years, confirming the worldwide spread of this microsporidian, a pathogen that negatively affects honey bee health at an individual and colony level. Trypanosomatids were also very prevalent in honey bee colonies, although the majority of Trypanosomatids detected were not Crithidia mellificae but rather the genetically distinct Lotmaria passim lineage. We also detected Varroa destructor mites, and the particularly high prevalence in 2014 suggests a possible problem regarding mite control in field conditions that requires attention. In agreement with data from other regions, the BQCV and DWV were the most prevalent viruses in honey bee colonies and thus, the Varroa-DWV interaction may be an important cause of bee colony mortality. While there was little evidence of a relationship between the BQCV virus and N. ceranae under field conditions during 2012, this was not the case in 2013 and 2014. Finally, the AKI-complex or LSV-complex was not detected. The information obtained in this study should help orientate future plans for honey bee disease control."
Incidence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in triatomines collected at Indio Mountains Research Station,"Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is an emerging infectious disease in the United States. In our study, 24 out of 39 triatomines, from the specie Triatoma rubida, were infected with T. cruzi. Additionally, only the genotype TcI was characterized among the parasite specimens. Improved knowledge of local epidemiology is needed to prevent transmission of Chagas disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Ecological, Social and Biological Risk Factors for Continued Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission by Triatoma dimidiata in Guatemala","Background: Chagas disease transmission by Triatoma dimidiata persists in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America under undefined ecological, biological and social (eco-bio-social) conditions. Methodology: Eco-bio-social risk factors associated with persistent domiciliary infestation were identified by a cross-sectional survey and qualitative participatory methods. Quantitative and qualitative data were generated regarding Trypanosoma cruzi reservoirs and triatomine hosts. Blood meal analysis and infection of insects, dogs and rodents were determined. Based on these data, multimodel inference was used to identify risk factors for domestic infestation with the greatest relative importance (>0.75). Principal Findings: Blood meal analysis showed that 64% of 36 bugs fed on chickens, 50% on humans, 17% on dogs; 24% of 34 bugs fed on Rattus rattus and 21% on Mus musculus. Seroprevalence among 80 dogs was 37%. Eight (17%) of 46 M. musculus and three (43%) of seven R. rattus from households with infected triatomines were infected with T. cruzi Distinct Typing Unit I. Results from interviews and participatory meetings indicated that vector control personnel and some householders perceived chickens roosting and laying eggs in the house as bug infestation risk factors. House construction practices were seen as a risk factor for bug and rodent infestation, with rodents being perceived as a pest by study participants. Multimodel inference showed that house infestation risk factors of high relative importance are dog density, mouse presence, interior wall plaster condition, dirt floor, tile roofing and coffee tree presence. Conclusions/Significance: Persistent house infestation is closely related to eco-bio-social factors that maintain productive T. dimidiata habitats associated with dogs, chickens and rodents. Triatomine, dog and rodent infections indicate active T. cruzi transmission. Integrated vector control methods should include actions that consider the role of peridomestic animals in transmission and community members level of knowledge, attitudes and practices associated with the disease and transmission process."
"First report of Trypanosoma vivax outbreak in dairy cattle in Sao Paulo state, Brazil","This is the first description of a trypanosoma vivax outbreak in the state of Sao Paulo (municipality of Lins). Fever, jaundice, decreased milk production, weight loss, profuse diarrhea, abortion, anemia, leukocytosis and hyperfibrinogenemia were observed in the affected animals. Thirty-one cows and calves died out of a total of 1080 in the herd. Three cows showed neurological symptoms like dysmetria, ataxia, muscle weakness, ptyalism, lymph node enlargement and submandibular edema. Flagellated hemoparasites were observed in blood smears. The species was diagnosed as T vivax by means of PCR. This T vivax strain showed resistance to diaminazene aceturate and the infection spread quickly at the herd. From the ELISA test, 599 serum samples (98.36%) were positive for anti-T. vivax IgG antibodies. This outbreak occurred during a very dry period, which indicates that other factors were involved in the outbreak, such as absence of tabanids and large populations of Haematobia irritans and Stomoxys calcitrans. The increases in these populations may have been due to the use of biosolid waste from sugar and ethanol plants in the sugarcane plantations surrounding the dairy farm."

"Zoonosis in dogs and cats attended by the Birth Control Project: Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania spp. and Leptospira spp., serodiagnosis and epidemiology","Increasing human-animal proximity has also increased risks of zoonotic disease transmission. This study measured the prevalence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii, anti-Leishmania spp. and anti-Leptospira spp. IgG antibodies in dogs and cats attended by the Birth Control Project (BCP) from 2004 to 2012 to determine which environmental variables were significantly associated with infectious agents in the study population. Blood samples from 271 dogs and 415 cats were collected by jugular or cephalic venipuncture for serological analysis. Indirect immunofluorescence assays were used to detect anti-T. gondii and anti-Leishmania spp. IgG antibodies and microscopic serum-agglutination tests were used to detect anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies. Data tabulation and statistical analyses were performed using EpiInfo (3.4.3). Among canine sera samples, 20.6% (56/271), 1.3% (3/236), and 21.6% (51/236) were positive for T. gondii, Leishmania spp., and Leptospira spp., respectively. Higher T. gondii prevalence was found in dogs of unknown breeding history (p=0.0009), those fed raw or undercooked meat (p=0.0101), and those that did not receive the polyvalent vaccine (p=0.0147). There was no statistically significant association between leishmaniosis and leptospirosis and variables evaluated in the epidemiological questionnaire. Among feline sera samples, 20.9% (87/415) were positive for T. gondii. The highest prevalence rates were observed in felines that hunted rodents (p=0.0388) and that consumed untreated water (p=0.0294). These results confirmed that ingestion of raw or undercooked meat, drinking untreated water, and predation of rodents were important risk factors for T. gondii infection. A low Leishmania spp. serodiagnostic prevalence was observed. The most frequent Leptospira spp. serovars were Copenhageni, Canicola, and Butembo."
Leishmania in synanthropic rodents (Rattus rattus): new evidence for the urbanization of Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis,"This study aimed to detect parasites from Leishmania genus, to determine the prevalence of anti-Leishmaniaspp.antibodies,toidentifycirculating species of the parasite, and to determine epidemiological variables associated with infection in rats caught in urban area of Londrina, Parana, Brazil. Animal capture was carried out from May to December 2006, serological and molecular methods were performed. DNA was extracted from total blood, and nested-PCR, targeting SSu rRNA from Leishmania genus, was performed in triplicate. The positive samples were sequenced twice by Sanger method to species determination. In total, 181 rodents were captured, all were identified as Rattus rattus and none showed clinical alterations. Forty-one of the 176 (23.3%) animals were positive for Leishmania by ELISA and 6/181 (3.3%) were positive by IFAT. Nine of 127 tested animals (7.1%) were positive by PCR; seven were identified as L. (L.) amazonensis, one as L. (L.) infantum. Four rats were positive using more than one test. This was the first description of synanthropic rodents naturally infected by L. (L.) amazonensis (in the world) and by L. (L.) infantum (in South Brazil). Regarding L. (L.) amazonensis, this finding provides new evidence of the urbanization of this etiological agent."

Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in dogs: is high seroprevalence indicative of a reservoir role?,"American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is a complex disease with a rich diversity of animal host species. This diversity imposes a challenge, since understanding ACL transmission requires the adequate identification of reservoir hosts, those species able to be a source of additional infections. In this study we present results from an ACL cross-sectional serological survey of 51 dogs (Canis familiaris), where we used diagnostic tests that measure dog's exposure to Leishmania spp. parasites. We did our research in Panama, at a village that has undergone significant ecosystem level transformations. We found an ACL seroprevalence of 47% among dogs, and their exposure was positively associated with dog age and abundance of sand fly vectors in the houses of dog owners. Using mathematical models, which were fitted to data on the proportion of positive tests as function of dog age, we estimated a basic reproductive number (R-0 +/- S.E.) of 1.22 +/- 0.09 that indicates the disease is endemically established in the dogs. Nevertheless, this information by itself is insufficient to incriminate dogs as ACL reservoirs, given the inability to find parasites (or their DNA) in seropositive dogs and previously reported failures to experimentally infect vectors feeding on dogs with ACL parasites."
"Relationship between asymptomatic infections with Anaplasma marginale, Babesia spp. and Trypanosoma vivax in bulls and testosterone levels","Some bovine hemotropic infections are associated with decreased reproductive potential in bulls, but the underlying mechanisms involved are poorly understood. The main objective of this transversal study was to determine Anaplasma marginale, Babesia spp., and Trypanosoma vivax infections in asymptomatic bulls (n=85) of various breeds and ages, and to compare serum average testosterone levels in infected and non-infected animals. The highest prevalence by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was 46% for A. marginale, 34% for Babesia spp. and 60% for T. vivax. The greatest percentages of bulls infected with A. marginale and Babesia spp. were found in the Holstein breed (75.0 and 66.7%, respectively), and the lowest in the Carora breed (35.7 and 14.2%, respectively) with values of P<0.001. The percentage of bulls infected with T. vivax was higher in the Holstein, Carora and Mixed Breeds (75.0, 71.4 and 76.5%) as compared to the Brahman breed (38.1%). The highest percentages of infection with A. marginale and Babesia spp. were found in animals 1019 months old and less than 29 months old, respectively, while the highest percentage of infection with T. vivax was observed in 40-49 months old animals. These results show the importance of the breed and age in the selection of individuals for studies of prevalence, treatment and epidemiological control. Hematocrit values were statistically lower in animals infected with A. marginale as compared to the non-infected group (P<0.02). Bulls infected with T. vivax presented lower levels of serum testosterone, while bulls either infected with A. marginale or Babesia spp. or noninfected, showed no differences in this hormone. The decrease in testosterone levels in bulls appears to correlate with T. vivax chronic infection, suggesting a link between the presence of this pathogen and hormonal levels."
"PARTICIPATION OF TICKS IN THE INFECTIOUS CYCLE OF CANINE VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS, IN TERESINA, PIAUI, BRAZIL","In this study, we detected Leishmania spp. infection in R. sanguineus collected from dogs that were naturally infected with L. (L.) infantum. We examined 35 dogs of both sexes and unknown ages. The infected dogs were serologically positive by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Quick Test-DPP (Dual Path Platform), as well as parasitological examination of a positive skin biopsy or sternal bone marrow aspiration. Ten negative dogs were included as controls. The ticks that infested these dogs were collected in pools of 10 adult females per animal. The PCR was performed with specific primers for Leishmania spp., which amplified a 720-bp fragment. Of the 35 analyzed samples, a product was observed in eight samples (8/ 35; 22.9%). We conclude that the presence of parasite DNA suggests that ticks participate in the zoonotic cycle of canine visceral leishmaniasis, in the city of Teresina, Piaui."
"Seroprevalence of Leishmania infection and molecular detection of Leishmania tropica and Leishmania infanturn in stray cats of Izmir, Turkey","Leishmaniasis caused by more than 20 species of genus Leishmania is transmitted by the bite of infected phlebotomine sand flies. The studies on Leishmania infection in cats is very few in Turkey and therefore we aimed to screen stray cats living in city of Izmir located in western Turkey using nested PCR targeting kinetoplast DNA and serological techniques (ELISA and IFA). Leishmania DNA positive samples were also studied by ITS1 real time PCR. Whole blood and serum samples were obtained from stray cats (n: 1101) living in different counties of Izmir. In serological assays, a serum sample was considered positive in 1:40 dilution in IFA and for ELISA a serum sample was accepted positive when the absorbance value (AV) exceeded the mean AV + Standard Deviation (SD) of the negative control serum samples. According to the results, the seropositivity rates were 10.8% (119/1101) and 15.2% (167/1101) by in house ELISA and IFA, respectively. Among serology coherent samples, the seropositivity rate was 11.1% (116/1047) as detected by both assays after discordant samples (n: 54) were discarded. Of the 1101 stray cats, six (0.54%) were positive by nested PCR while only one of these six samples was positive by ITS1 real time PCR. During PCR, three controls designated as Leishmania infantum, Leishmania tropica, and Leishmania major were used for species identification. According to nested PCR results, L. tropica was identified in two cats (no.76 and 95). In another cat (no. 269), there were two bands in which one of them was well matched with L infantum and the other band had similar to 850 bp size which does not match with any controls. Remaining three cats (no. 86, 514, and 622) also had the similar to 850 bp atypical band size. ITS1 real time PCR detected L tropica in only one cat (no. 622) which showed an atypical band size in nested PCR. These results indicated that three cats with only one atypical band (no. 86, 514, and 622) and the cat with mixed infection (no. 269) were infected with L tropica. Altogether, L tropica was detected in all six DNA positive cats and L infantum was detected in one cat with mixed infection. In conclusion, although the reservoir role of cats in nature is still unclear the high seroprevalence rate against Leishmania parasites and detecting parasite DNA in stray cats in Izmir indicates that the stray cats are frequently bitten by infected sand flies. Further research activities are required to reveal the frequency of leishmaniasis in cats in different regions of Turkey where Leishmania species are endemic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania spp. infection in cats from Brazil,A total of 386 feline blood samples from Brazil were collected and analyzed by the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) for the presence of Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania spp. antibodies. Specific antitoxoplasma IgG were found in 63 of 386 (16.3%) cats and immunoglobulin G against Leishmania spp. was detected in two serum samples. The overall prevalence was significantly higher in adult cats than in juvenile cats for T. gondii infection. There were no significant differences between positivity and gender or breed. The frequency of T. gondii antibodies found in domestic cats of Brazil suggests active transmission within an urban environment. This study proved the occurrence of two important protozoan zoonosis in felines from Brazilian endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
A prospective study of the effects of sustained vector surveillance following community-wide insecticide application on Trypanosoma cruzi infection of dogs and cats in rural northwestern Argentina,"Domestic dogs were used as natural sentinels to assess prospectively the long-term impact of selective, community-based spraying with pyrethroid insecticides after community-wide spraying on transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in rural villages under surveillance between 1992 and 2002. In 2000 and 2002 light infestations by Triatoma infestans were recorded, and 523 dogs and cats were examined serologically or by xenodiagnosis. The prevalence of T cruzi infection in dogs decreased from 65% at baseline to 8.9% and 4.7% at 7.5 and 10 years after sustained vector surveillance, respectively. The average annual force of infection dropped 260-fold from 72.7 per 100 dog-years at baseline to < 0.3% in 2002, as determined prospectively and retrospectively from the age-prevalence curve of native dogs born during surveillance. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that prevalent cases in dogs in 2000 and 2002 were associated positively and significantly with the peak number of T infestans caught in domestic areas at the dog's compound during its lifetime. The sustained decline in T. cruzi infections in dogs and cats is the result of selective, community-based insecticide spraying that kept the abundance of infected T infestans at marginal levels, fast host population turnover, and low immigration rates from areas with active transmission."
Molecular epidemiology of domestic and sylvatic Trypanosoma cruzi infection in rural northwestern Argentina,"Genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi populations and parasite transmission dynamics have been well documented throughout the Americas, but few studies have been conducted in the Gran Chaco ecoregion, one of the most highly endemic areas for Chagas disease, caused by T cruzi. In this study, we assessed the distribution of T cruzi lineages (identified by PCR strategies) in Triatoma infestans, domestic dogs, cats. humans and sylvatic mammals from two neighbouring rural areas with different histories of transmission and vector control in northern Argentina. Lineage II predominated amongst the 99 isolates characterised and lineage I amongst the six isolates obtained from sylvatic mammals. T cruzi lineage lie predominated in domestic habitats; it was found in 87%, of 54 isolates from Tr. infestans. in 82% of 33 isolates from dogs, and in the four cats found infected. Domestic and sylvatic cycles overlapped in the study area in the late 1980s, when intense domestic transmission occurred, and still overlap marginally. The introduction of T. cruzi from sylvatic into domestic habitats is likely to occur very rarely in the current epidemiological context. The household distribution of T cruzi lineages showed that Tr infestans, dogs and cats from a given house compound shared the same parasite lineage in most cases. Based on molecular evidence, this result lends further Support to the importance of dogs and cats as domestic reservoir hosts of T cruzi. We believe that in Argentina, this is the first time that lineage IIe has been isolated from naturally infected domestic dogs and Tr. infestans. (C) 2008 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

Heterogeneities in the Ecoepidemiology of Trypanosoma cruzi Infection in Rural Communities of the Argentinean Chaco,"We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Trypanosoma cruzi infection of Triatoma infestans as well as dogs and cats in 327 households from a well-defined rural area in northeastern Argentina to test whether the household distribution of infection differed between local ethnic groups (Tobas and Creoles) and identify risk factors for host infection. Overall prevalence of infection of bugs (27.2%; 95% confidence interval = 25.3-29.3%), dogs (26.0%; 95% confidence interval = 23.3-30.1%), and cats examined (28.7%; 95% confidence interval = 20.2-39.0%) was similar. A multimodel inference approach showed that infection in dogs was associated strongly with the intensity and duration of local exposure to infected bugs and moderately with household ethnic background. Overall, Toba households were at a substantially greater risk of infection than Creole households. The strong heterogeneities in the distribution of bug, dog, and cat infections at household, village, and ethnic group levels may be used for targeted vector and disease control."
First report of Anaplasma platys infection in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and molecular detection of Ehrlichia canis and Leishmania infantum in foxes from Portugal,"Background: The bacteria Anaplasma platys and Ehrlichia canis and the protozoan Leishmania infantum are vector-borne agents that cause canine vector-borne diseases, some of which are zoonotic. The present survey investigated the prevalence of Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Leishmania in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from Portugal by molecular analysis, in order to evaluate the epidemiological role of these canids as reservoirs of infection. Methods: Blood and/or bone marrow samples were collected from 78 red foxes obtained in eight districts of northern, central and southern Portugal. Real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCR) amplified a 123 bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene of Anaplasma spp. and Ehrlichia spp. and a 265 bp fragment of the L. infantum internal transcribed spacer one (ITS1) region of the rRNA operon evaluated by PCR-high resolution melt analysis (PCR-HRM), with sequencing of the DNA products. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out to compare these to other sequences from Anaplasma spp. and Ehrlichia spp. deposited in GenBank (R). Results: A. platys was detected in 10 (14.5%) and E. canis in two (2.9%) out of 69 foxes; and L. infantum was detected in one (1.3%) of the 78 foxes. The prevalence of A. platys was significantly different from the prevalence of E. canis (p=0.016) and from that of L. infantum (p=0.002). No co-infections were found in any one of the 78 foxes. No statistically significant differences were found between the type of sample (blood and bone marrow), geographic regions (north/centre and south), age (< 2 years and >= 2 years) and gender for any one of the agents. Conclusions: This is the first known report of A. platys in red foxes worldwide, as well as the first molecular evidence of E. canis in foxes from Portugal. The moderate prevalence of A. platys suggests that red foxes may play a role in the epidemiology of infection with this bacterium and serve as a reservoir for domestic dogs."
Low seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in cats from northern Portugal based on DAT and ELISA,"Cats have been considered playing a role in the epidemiology of leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum, an endemic zoonosis in countries of the Mediterranean basin. The present study assessed the prevalence of antibodies to L infantum in 316 domestic cats from northern Portugal, by means of the direct agglutination test (DAT) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Seroreactivity to DAT was found in six cats, and nine cats were positive in the ELISA, including the six DAT-positive animals. The overall seroprevalence of Leishmania infection was 2.8%, based on ELISA and DAT. A substantial agreement (99%; K value = 0.80) was found between DAT and ELISA results. The difference between seroprevalence values in females (0.7%) and males (4.7%) was statistically significant (p = 0.045). The age of seropositive cats ranged from 31 to 84 months. Cats with 5-6 years (60-71 months) and 6-7 years (72-83 months) presented the highest level of seropositivity (15.4% and 33.3%, respectively). A significant difference was found comparing the seroprevalences in cats aged less than 24 months (0.0%) and in those with 24 months or more (7.3%) (p=0.022). Seroprevalences in cats living in a rural environment (10.5%) or in urban areas (0.0%) were also found to be significantly different (p<0.001). No significant differences were detected between serological status to Leishmania in pure non-European and European or mixed breeds (p=0.442), cats that lived totally indoors and those that had access to outdoors (p=0.412), cats seropositive and seronegative to Toxoplasma gondii (p=0.276), or apparently healthy animals and those with clinical illness (p=0.271). This study is the largest epidemiological investigation performed on feline Leishmania infection in Portugal. The seroprevalence of Leishmania infection was low in cats living in northern Portugal, a region where canine leishmaniosis is endemic. Nevertheless, Leishmania infection must not be underestimated and leishmaniosis may be included in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous or systemic clinical signs in cats. (C) 2010 Elsevier ay.

"Sero-epidemiological study of canine Leishmania spp. infection in the municipality of Alijo (Alto Douro, Portugal)","Visceral leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is a zoonotic disease in the Mediterranean basin. We report an epidemiological survey carried out in dogs from the municipality of Aligo in the endemic region of Alto Douro (north Portugal). Performance of the direct agglutination test (DAT) was assessed in 205 matching samples of blood collected on filter paper and serum. A high degree of agreement (97.6%; kappa = 0.83) was found between the results obtained from both types of samples. DAT was then used to test more blood on filter paper (B-FP) samples from other dogs of the same municipality. The detected sero-prevalence was 18.7% (288/1540), with values ranging from 0.0 to 81.1% in each of the 19 parishes of Alijo. Three distinct geographical zones of mean sero-prevalence could be defined: northwestern (2.5%), intermediate (11.4%) and southern (49.9%). No statistically significant difference was observed between male (19.1%) and female (17.8%) sero-prevalences (P = 0.560). Dogs of 9-11 years of age showed the highest sero-prevalence (28.4%), but all the other age-intervals (0-2, 3-5, 6-8 and 12-17 years) presented values (15.0-22.3%) not significantly different from the mean of the whole study population. Risk factors for canine Leishmania infection were age and geographical zone. Only 5.9% of the sero-positive animals had clinical signs of canine leishmaniosis and the overall prevalence of disease was 1.1%. This study validates the use of B-FP samples and confirms DAT as a simple and sensitive serological test to evaluate the level of canine Leishmania infection in areas of high sero-prevalence.

"Serological survey of Leishmania infection in dogs from the municipality of Peso da Re'gua (Alto Douro, Portugal) using the direct agglutination test (DAT) and fast agglutination screening test (FAST)","Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum is a prevalent disease in dogs and humans. A serological survey of Leishmania infection in dogs was carried out in the endemic region of Alto Douro (north Portugal). Two hundred and ninety-four dogs from the municipality of Peso da Regua were examined for clinical signs of canine leishmaniasis (CanL), and sera samples were evaluated by the direct agglutination test (DAT) and the fast agglutination screening test (FAST). The sero-prevalence of infection was 20.4%, after screening the study population by FAST and subsequent confirmation by DAT. The overall prevalence of disease was 3.1%. Only 15.0% of the sero-positive dogs had clinical signs of CanL. A high degree of agreement (88.4%; kappa value = 0.71) was found between DAT and FAST. This study further demonstrates that FAST can be used as a simple, rapid and sensitive screening test for canine Leishmania infection in areas of high endemicity and, together with DAT, is a valuable tool in the assessment of CanL.

Expanding the knowledge about Leishmania species in wild mammals and dogs in the Brazilian savannah,"Background: Wild, synanthropic and domestic mammals act as hosts and/or reservoirs of several Leishmania spp. Studies on possible reservoirs of Leishmania in different areas are fundamental to understand host-parasite interactions and develop strategies for the surveillance and control of leishmaniasis. In the present study, we evaluated the Leishmania spp. occurrence in mammals in two conservation units and their surroundings in Brasilia, Federal District (FD), Brazil. Methods: Small mammals were captured in Brasilia National Park (BNP) and Contagem Biological Reserve (CBR) and dogs were sampled in residential areas in their vicinity. Skin and blood samples were evaluated by PCR using different molecular markers (D7 24Sa rRNA and rDNA ITS1). Leishmania species were identified by sequencing of PCR products. Dog blood samples were subjected to the rapid immunochromatographic test (DPP) for detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies. Results: 179 wild mammals were studied and 20.1% had Leishmania DNA successfully detected in at least one sample. Six mammal species were considered infected: Clyomys laticeps, Necromys lasiurus, Nectomys rattus, Rhipidomys macrurus, Didelphis albiventris and Gracilinanus agilis. No significant difference, comparing the proportion of individuals with Leishmania spp., was observed between the sampled areas and wild mammal species. Most of the positive samples were collected from the rodent N. lasiurus, infected by L. amazonensis or L. braziliensis. Moreover, infections by Trypanosoma spp. were detected in N. lasiurus and G. agilis. All 19 dog samples were positive by DPP; however, only three (15.8%) were confirmed by PCR assays. DNA sequences of ITS1 dog amplicons showed 100% identity with L. infantum sequence. Conclusions: The results suggest the participation of six species of wild mammals in the enzootic transmission of Leishmania spp. in FD. This is the first report of L. amazonensis in N. lasiurus."
TRYPANOSOMA SPP IN RATS (Rattus rattus AND Rattus norvegicus) FROM TWO ENVIRONMENTS: FOOD MARKETS AND PIG FARMS,"The aim of the study was to determine the presence of Trypanosoma spp in Rattus spp from food markets and pig farms in Lima, Peru, to identify the species of Trypanosoma spp by morphological and biometric characterization, and to correlate the presence of the parasite with the variables sex, age (juvenile and adult), origin and species. The study was conducted in eight food markets of six districts (n = 62 rats) and three pig farms (n = 99) from three districts of Lima. Blood samples were collected and analysed using the thin blood smear technique and stained with ''Hemacolor'' to determine the presence of the parasite. The identification of the Trypanosome species was based on international keys based on the morphological and biometric characteristics of the trypomastigotes present in blood smears stained with Giemsa. T lewisi was the only species found in a frequency of 22.5 and 21.2% in rats from the food markets and pig farms, respectively. The frequency of T lewisi in R. norvegicus and R. rattus was 10.2 and 26.7%, in male and female rats was 21.1 and 22.0%, and in adults and juveniles was 17.0 and 26.5%, respectively. There was no significant association with the variables of origin, sex, and age. R. rattus showed a significant risk factor (OR: 3.77) against R. norvegicus for the presentation of T. lewisi."
"Parasites and Pathogens of Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis): A Field Survey of a Population Nesting Within a Grass-Dominated Agricultural Habitat in Georgia, U.S.A., with a Review of Previous Records","The parasite community associated with a population of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) nesting in a grassdominated habitat in northern Georgia, U.S.A., was surveyed by live examination of adults and nestlings; examination of feces, nesting materials, and blood smears; necropsy; and polymerase chain reaction techniques. During the course of 5 breeding seasons, we found 10 macroparasite species, which included I tick species (lxodes brunneus), 1 louse species (Philopterus sialii), 1 species of hematophagous mite (Dermanvssus prognephilus), and 5 other species not previously reported from eastern bluebirds, including an acanthocephalan (Plagiorhynchus cylindraceus), a species of strongyloid nematode, a cestode (Hymenolepis sp.), a nestling bird fly (Carnus floridensis), and a nest mite (Campephilocoptes sp.); a description of feather mites associated with the population was not included in this report. Overall prevalence of macroparasites was 16.1%. We also detected 5 species of protistan parasites, including Haemoproteus fallisi, Plasmodium relic/urn, Trypanosoma avium, and 2 others, an Atoxoplasma sp. and a Sarcocystis sp., which represent new host parasite records. One bird tested positive for West Nile virus and for St. Louis encephalitis virus. More than 50% of the birds examined were infected with 1 or more microparasites. Prevalence of microparasites varied by examination method employed. An updated list of known parasites of eastern bluebirds gathered from published literature and database searches is provided."
"DIVERSITY AND PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS OF HEMOSPORIDIAN PARASITES IN BIRDS OF SOCORRO ISLAND, MEXICO, AND THEIR ROLE IN THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF THE SOCORRO DOVE (ZENAIDA GRAYSONI)","The Socorro dove Zenaida graysoni, endemic to Socorro Island, was last reported in the wild in 1972. Fortunately, the species has been propagated in zoos in Europe and the United States, and plans are under way to re-introduce it to its native habitat. This will be the first known attempt to return a bird species extinct in the wild to its ancestral island. In order to assess the disease threats the Socorro dove may face, the avifauna of Socorro Island, with a specific focus on Socorro ground doves Columbina passerina socorroensis and mourning doves Zenaida macroura, as well as Socorro doves in captivity, were screened for blood parasites of the genera Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Trypanosoma spp. We found Haemoproteus spp. in 17 (74%) of 23 Socorro ground doves, 23 (92%) of 25 mourning doves, and 3 (14%) of 21 northern mockingbirds; none of the other bird species showed infections. Here, we report the phylogenetic analysis of 19 distinct lineages of Haemoproteus spp. detected in birds of Socorro Island and compare their evolutionary relationships to parasites detected in the avifauna of the Galapagos Islands, continental Latin America, and Europe. Microscopic examination revealed 1 mourning dove infected with Plasmodium (Haemamoeba), thus underscoring the importance of using both PCR and microscopy when analyzing avian blood samples for hemosporidian parasites. The study confirms that the Socorro dove will most likely be exposed to Haemoproteus spp. that currently infect mourning doves and Socorro ground doves of Socorro Island. A monitoring program for both birds and vectors should be implemented to establish the prevalence of Plasmodium sp. and as a necessary conservation measure for critically endangered birds on the island."
PREVALENCE OF TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI AND ORGAN ALTERATIONS IN VIRGINIA OPOSSUMS (DIDELPHIS VIRGINIANA) FROM WESTERN MEXICO - SHORT COMMUNICATION,"Small populations of Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) in western Mexico are endangered by hunting and natural predators as well as by different kinds of diseases. After two serological analyses using Serodia (R) latex particle agglutination and indirect haemagglutination (IHA) tests, 35 (53.03%) of 66 collected opossums in two small towns in western Mexico were positive for the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi. Twenty-eight of the 35 seropositive opossums had pathological lesions: 11 had changes in only one organ, 13 in two organs, and four had pathological changes in three organs. Splenomegaly was the most common finding in the examined opossums, followed by hepatomegaly. These potentially fatal pathological changes could contribute to the scarcity of the opossum population, even leading to the extinction of this species in western Mexico."
Natural infection of Didelphis aurita (Mammalia: Marsupialia) with Leishmania infantum in Brazil,"Background: The opossum Didelphis have been considered as natural hosts of Leishmania parasites in the New World, suggesting an important role in the epidemiology of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). Among six extant species that belong to the genus Didelphis, only two (D. marsupialis and D. albiventris), have been mentioned as natural hosts of Leishmania infantum in Brazil and Colombia. In the present paper, it is reported for the first time, the observation of intracellular parasites (amastigotes) in tissues of Didelphis aurita naturally infected with Leishmania infantum in Brazil. We also discuss some aspects associated to the relationship between L. infantum and the geographical distribution of some species of the genus Didelphis. Methods: The opossums studied were caught by wire traps (Tomahawk) in Barra de Guaratiba, a peri-urban area in Rio de Janeiro. The opossums were killed with an overdose of Thiopental sodium. At necropsy, macroscopic alterations were examined and samples from liver, spleen, lymph nodes, ear, abdominal skin, scent glands and bone marrow were collected for parasitological and molecular diagnoses. Results: Forty-eight opossums were captured in an AVL endemic region, 30 being caught in a mangrove area and eighteen animals in a forest area near to some residential-yards. Among the thirty opossums trapped in the mangrove area, all of them were negative by both imprint and sera samples assayed on Dipstick Tests, that is a test based on a combination of protein-A colloidal gold conjugate and rk39 Leishmania antigen to detect anti-Leishmania antibody in serum or plasma. At the macroscopic examination one out of eighteen opossums, caught close to the forest, presented alterations compatible with spleen hypertrophy and three were positive by Dipstick Tests (16.6%) and presented amastigotes in the spleen and in one of them, the parasites were also observed in a submandibular lymph node. Leishmania infantum infections were confirmed through dot blot hybridization using a L. infantum-specific biotinylated probe. Conclusions: In the present paper we present the first report of amastigotes in the tissues of Didelphis aurita (Mammalia: Marsupialia) naturally infected with Leishmania infantum. We also attempt to claim the particular role of some opossum species as hosts of Leishmania infantum, contributing at least in part on the description of potential sylvatic reservoirs."
"Cross-sectional survey of health management and prevalence of vector-borne diseases, endoparasites and ectoparasites in Samoan dogs","ObjectiveTo determine the prevalence of selected canine vector-borne diseases (Leishmania infantum, Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Dirofilaria immitis) and endo- and ectoparasites in Samoan dogs presenting for surgical sterilisation and to report on the general health management of the dogs. MethodsThis study was a prospective serological cross-sectional survey. Management data were obtained for 242 dogs by interview with their owners. Blood samples were collected from 237 dogs and screened for the canine vector-borne diseases using point-of-care qualitative ELISA assays. Anaplasma spp. positive samples were screened by PCR and sequenced for species identification. Rectal faecal samples were collected from 204 dogs for faecal flotation and immunofluorescent antibody tests were performed for Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. on a subset of 93 faecal samples. The skin and coat of 221 dogs were examined for presence of ectoparasites. ResultsThe D. immitis antigen was detected in 46.8% (111/237) of dogs. Seroprevalence of Anaplasma spp. was 8.4% (20/237); A. platys was confirmed by PCR. Prevalence of hookworm was 92.6% (185/205) and Giardia was 29.0% (27/93). Ectoparasites were detected on 210/221 (95.0%) of dogs examined and 228/242 dogs (94.2%) had previously never received any preventative medication. ConclusionsThere was a very high prevalence of D. immitis, hookworm and external parasites in Samoan dogs, and prophylactic medication is rarely administered. This is the first report confirming A. platys in Samoa and the South Pacific islands. The public health implications of poor management of the dogs should be considered and investigated further."
"Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis in dogs in Brazil: epidemiology, co-infection, and clinical aspects","Leishmaniasis is an endemic disease present in 98 countries. In Brazil, the northeast region accounts for approximately half of the cases in humans, and has experienced an increased number of positive cases in dogs. In this study, we investigated the epidemiology of canine leishmaniasis in the city of Ilheus, Bahia, using serological and molecular techniques and evaluated the possible environmental risk factors and associated clinical signs. Blood samples were collected from 560 dogs in urban and peri-urban areas in Ilheus, northeastern Brazil. Genomic DNA was extracted from the selected animals and subjected to molecular analysis using Leishmania species-specific primers and diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi. A total of 54.72% of dogs were positive for Leishmania braziliensis, and animals positive for both Leishmania infantum and T. cruzi were not identified. Hematologic variables were not statistically associated with cases of L. braziliensis. However, the positive animal group showed lower red blood cell and platelet counts and higher levels of urea and serum creatinine. Few dogs presented clinical signs compatible with the presence of Leishmania. Age of more than 2 years and specific hair colors were associated with positive results for L. braziliensis. The geoclimatic characteristics of the region may improve parasite survival, reproduction, and vectors. This may explain the higher rate of dogs identified as positive in this study."
Preliminary study of the effects of preventive measures on the prevalence of Canine Leishmaniosis in a recently established focus in northern Italy,"Canine Leishmaniosis is endemic in Mediterranean areas, with a well-documented northward spread. The mass use of preventive measures against sandfly bites (collar and spot-on formulations) was tested in a small focus recently established in an isolated hilly area of north-eastern Italy (Colli Euganei). In 2006 and 2007, a total of 449 dogs living in the southern part of Colli Euganei were screened against Leishmania infantum using an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), and 31 (6.9%) were seropositive. A risk factor analysis clearly described the focus as limited to a small village named Calaone. In 2010, 63 animals from Calaone were sampled and their owners interviewed to verify the effectiveness of the preventive measures. According to what reported by owners, dogs started to be protected in 2006 (66.7% dogs protected), and protection rate incremented (around 90%) during the subsequent years. The seroprevalence value (4.2%) of the youngest age class (<5 years) was significantly lower than other classes, demonstrating that animals born after 2006 had low probabilities of getting infected. Besides, seroprevalence value referred only to dogs living in Calaone was 32.4% (23/71) in 2006-2007 and 20.6% (13/63) in 2010, showing a decreasing trend. Although still preliminary, the results show high sensitization of dog owners and suggest that the mass use of collars and spot-on acts positively in reducing the circulation of L. infantum."
The potential of canine sentinels for reemerging Trypanosoma cruzi transmission,"Background: Chagas disease, a vector-borne disease transmitted by triatomine bugs and caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects millions of people in the Americas. In Arequipa, Peru, indoor residual insecticide spraying campaigns are routinely conducted to eliminate Triatoma infestans, the only vector in this area. Following insecticide spraying, there is risk of vector return and reinitiation of parasite transmission. Dogs are important reservoirs of T. cruzi and may play a role in reinitiating transmission in previously sprayed areas. Dogs may also serve as indicators of reemerging transmission. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional serological screening to detect T. cruzi antibodies in dogs, in conjunction with an entomological vector collection survey at the household level, in a disease endemic area that had been treated with insecticide 13 years prior. Spatial clustering of infected animals and vectors was assessed using Ripley's K statistic, and the odds of being seropositive for dogs proximate to infected colonies was estimated with multivariate logistic regression. Results: There were 106 triatomine-infested houses (41.1%), and 45 houses infested with T. cruzi-infected triatomine insects (17.4%). Canine seroprevalence in the area was 12.3% (n=154); all seropositive dogs were 9 months old or older. We observed clustering of vectors carrying the parasite, but no clustering of seropositive dogs. The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio between seropositivity to T. cruzi and proximity to an infected triatomine (<= 50 m) was 5.67(95% CI: 1.12-28.74; p = 0.036). Conclusions: Targeted control of reemerging transmission can be achieved by improved understanding of T. cruzi in canine populations. Our results suggest that dogs may be useful sentinels to detect re-initiation of transmission following insecticide treatment. Integration of canine T. cruzi blood sampling into existing interventions for zoonotic disease control (e.g., rabies vaccination programs) can be an effective method of increasing surveillance and improving understanding of disease distribution.

Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis: Epidemiology of canine cutaneous leishmaniasis in the state of Parana (Brazil),"The present study examines the role that dogs play in the maintenance of the Leishmania cycle in the State of Parana, Southern Brazil. Dogs were examined in three regions where cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic or epidemic (R1-Vale da Ribeira; R2-Central region of Parana State and R3-Northern region). To determine serum prevalence rates ELISA was used. In regions endemic for Trypanosoma cruzi (R1 and R3), serum from dogs seroreactive towards Leishmania antigen was subjected to T cruzi adsorption in order to eliminate cross-reaction with common antigen epitopes. Concomitantly, dogs with cutaneous lesions were biopsied to isolate and identify parasites using RAPD. Leishmania were classified by the phenetic method using the Jaccard coefficient of similarity, and grouped by Unweighted Pair-Group Method using an Arithmetic Average (UPGMA). A total of 410 dogs were studied. In R1 (Vale da Ribeira) 159 dogs were evaluated of which 10 had anti-Leishmania antibody. In R2 (Central Parana), 39 animals were examined of which 8 were seropositive. In R3 (the North) 212 dogs were evaluated of which 39 animals were seropositive. Thirteen dogs had cutaneous lesions and the parasites were isolated from a dog with mucocutaneous lesion in R1, two animals with simple skin lesions in R2 and 10 dogs with multiple lesions in R3. The identification of the parasite by molecular methods showed it to be L. (Viannia) braziliensis. Based on this information, the role of domestic dogs in Leishmania infection of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Parana is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Molecular detection of Leishmania spp in Lutzomyia longipalpis in the city of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil","Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease that affects a large part of the world population. Knowing the sand fly fauna of a region is of fundamental importance for guiding health surveillance actions related to the prevention and control of leishmaniasis. A total of 86 specimens of sand flies (60 females and 26 males) were collected. Using the classification proposed by Galati (2003), the following species were identified: Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva, 1912), Migonemyia migonei (Franca, 1920), Evandromyia cortelezzi (Brethes, 1923), Ev. sallesi (Galvao & Coutinho, 1939), Nyssomyia whitmani (Atunes & Coutinho, 1939), Psathyromyia lutziana (Costa Lima, 1932), Ev. lenti (Mangabeira, 1938), Brumptomyia sp. (Franca and Parrot, 1921), and Pressatia sp. (Mangabeira, 1942). Using PCR with internal transcribed spacer target to identify infected sand flies, five Lu. longipalpis females were infected with Leishmania spp. Despite the small number of specimens collected, considerable species diversity was found in the study area."
"Classification of trypanosomatids from fruits and seeds using morphological, biochemical and molecular markers revealed several genera among fruit isolates","Trypanosomatids are widespread in several plant families and although most isolates have been classified as Phytomonas, other trypanosomatid genera can also infect plants. In order to assess the natural occurrence of non-Phytomonas trypanosomatids in plants wt: characterized 21 new trypanosomatid cultures, 18 from fruits and three from seeds of 17 plant species. The trypanosomatids from fruit and seeds were compared in terms of morphological. growth, biochemical and molecular features. The high diversity among the isolates permitted the classification of the new flagellates into the genera Crithidia and Leptotmonas as well as Phytomonos. The data showed that natural Fruit infection with non-Phytomonas trypanosomatids is more common than usually thought, bring detected in 43% of the fruit isolates.

Pathogen prevalence and abundance in honey bee colonies involved in almond pollination,"Honey bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops. Since 2006, US beekeepers have experienced high annual honey bee colony losses, which may be attributed to multiple abiotic and biotic factors, including pathogens. However, the relative importance of these factors has not been fully elucidated. To identify the most prevalent pathogens and investigate the relationship between colony strength and health, we assessed pathogen occurrence, prevalence, and abundance in Western US honey bee colonies involved in almond pollination. The most prevalent pathogens were Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Lake Sinai virus 2 (LSV2), Sacbrood virus (SBV), Nosema ceranae, and trypanosomatids. Our results indicated that pathogen prevalence and abundance were associated with both sampling date and beekeeping operation, that prevalence was highest in honey bee samples obtained immediately after almond pollination, and that weak colonies had a greater mean pathogen prevalence than strong colonies."
Long-term reduction of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in sylvatic mammals following deforestation and sustained vector surveillance in northwestern Argentina,"Long-term variations in the dynamics and intensity of sylvatic transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi were investigated around eight rural villages in the semiarid Argentine Chaco in 2002-2004 and compared to data collected locally in 1984-1991. Of 501 wild mammals from 13 identified species examined by xenodiagnosis, only 3 (7.9%) of 38 Didelphis albiventris opossums and 1 (1.1%) of 91 Conepatus chinga skunks were infected by T. cruzi. The period prevalence in opossums was four-fold lower in 2002-2004 than in 1984-1991 (32-36%). The infection prevalence of skunks also decreased five-fold from 4.1-5.6% in 1984-1991 to 1.1% in 2002-2004. Infection in opossums increased with age and from summer to spring in both study periods. The force of infection per 100, opossum-months after weaning declined more than six-fold from 8.2 in 1988-1991 to 1.2 in 2002-2004. Opossums were mainly infected by T. cruzi lineage I and secondarily by lineage IId in 1984-1991, and only by T. cruzi I in 2002-2004; skunks were infected by T. cruzi IId in 1984-1991 and by IIc in 2002-2004. The striking decline of T. cruzi infection in opossums and skunks occurred in parallel to community-wide insecticide spraying followed by selective sprays leading to very low densities of infected Triatoma infestans in domestic and peridomestic habitats since 1992; to massive deforestation around one of the villages or selective extraction of older trees, and apparent reductions in opossum abundance jointly with increases in foxes and skunks. These factors may underlie the dramatic decrease of T. cruzi infection in wild reservoir hosts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

"USE OF PCR, IFAT AND IN VITRO CULTURE IN THE DETECTION OF LEISHMANIA INFANTUM INFECTION IN DOGS AND EVALUATION OF THE PREVALENCE OF CANINE LEISHMANIASIS IN A LOW ENDEMIC AREA IN TUNISIA","The aim of this study was to assess the use of parasitological, serological and molecular methods for the detection of Leishmania infection in blood of 67 dogs and to investigate the prevalence of canine leishmaniasis (Cari in Koirouan (central Tunisia), an area known to be of reduced endemicity and has not been studied since 1973. Veterinarians clinically examined all dogs, and the liter of anti-Leishmania antibodies was determined by indirect immune-fluorescence antibody test. The presence of Leishmania was performed by PCR and in vitro culture. IFAT was positive in 12 % of dogs and promostigote form of the parasite was isolated by in vitro culture from only 4.5 % of them. However, DNA of Leishmania was detected by PCR in 20.9 % of dogs. PCR was more sensitive than IFAT (p = 0.004) and in vitro culture (p < 10(-5)). A prevalence of 21 % was found in Kairouan, which is significant high (p < 10(-3)) when compared to that of thirty years ago. This state is in correlation with the increase in other Mediterranean countries. Furthermore, 50 % of positive dogs were asymptomatic. Preventive measures must be taken against these dogs as for symptomatic ones since their role in the transmission of the infection to vectors has been proven."
Transmission of visceral leishmaniasis in a previously non-endemic region of Tunisia: Detection of Leishmania DNA in Phlebotomus perniciosus,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has been endemic in northern Tunisia and has occurred sporadically in the center of Tunisia. Recently, there have been several cases from areas known to be free of VL. We report in this work all human and canine cases of VL recorded between 2003 and 2011 and an entomological study of phlebotomine fauna in a previously non-endemic region. Sixty-three cases of VL were diagnosed and identified as L. infantum using several different methods. Eight species of 179 sand flies were caught and identified by both morphological and molecular methods. Two genera were present, Phlebotomus and Sergentomya, with an abundance of the subgenus Phlebotomus (Larrousius) spp., a classic vector of VL in Tunisia. Moreover, Leishmania DNA was detected in seven unfed Phlebotomus pernicousus and L. infantum was identified in three of them. This result confirms the establishment of a transmission cycle of VL in the studied region by the coexistence of infected vectors with infected hosts."
Transmission cycle analysis in a Leishmania infantum focus: Infection rates and blood meal origins in sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae),"An entomological study was conducted in a Leishmania infantum focus, including the identification of the sand fly species, the detection and the characterization of Leishmania DNA in female sand flies, and blood meal origins in engorged sand flies. A total of 643 sand flies (31% female, 69% male) was identified based on their morphological features or molecular markers. Ten different species were identified, with Phlebotomus perniciosus, the confirmed vector of L. infantum, being the most abundant (56%), P. papatasi in 25% of sand flies, the unique vector species of L. major, and P. longicuspis in 7% of cases, the suspected second vector of L. infantum. Moreover, the infection rate was 3.4% in P. perniciousus, P. papatasi, P. longicuspis, and Sergentomya minuta. Also, L. infantum was identified in five unfed P. perniciosus and two P. longicuspis. Our results suggest the vector role of P. perniciosus and P. longicuspis in the transmission cycle of L. infantum. The DNA of four mammalian species (human, rabbit, horse, and cow) was identified in the blood meals of sand flies, suggesting that these species are potential reservoirs of leishmaniasis, though it is not yet fully elucidated (especially for MON-24 and MON-80). We suggest the existence of different transmission cycles of L. infantum involving different species of sand flies and hosts."
Southern Plains Woodrats (Neotoma micropus) from Southern Texas Are Important Reservoirs of Two Genotypes of Trypanosoma cruzi and Host of a Putative Novel Trypanosoma Species,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, is an important public health and veterinary pathogen. Although human cases are rare in the United States, infections in wildlife, and in some areas domestic dogs, are common. In 2008 and 2010, we investigated T. cruzi prevalence in possible vertebrate reservoirs in southern Texas, with an emphasis on southern plains woodrats (Neotoma micropus). Infection status was determined using a combination of culture isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serologic testing. Based on PCR and/or culture, T. cruzi was detected in 35 of 104 (34%) woodrats, 3 of 4 (75%) striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), 12 of 20 (60%) raccoons (Procyon lotor), and 5 of 28 (18%) other rodents including a hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), rock squirrel (Otospermophilus variegatus), black rat (Rattus rattus), and two house mice (Mus musculus). Additionally, another Trypanosoma species was detected in 41 woodrats, of which 27 were co-infected with T. cruzi. Genetic characterization of T. cruzi revealed that raccoon, rock squirrel, and cotton rat isolates were genotype TcIV, while woodrats and skunks were infected with TcI and TcIV. Based on the Chagas Stat-Pak assay, antibodies were detected in 27 woodrats (26%), 13 raccoons (65%), 4 skunks (100%), and 5 other rodents (18%) (two white-ankled mice [Peromyscus pectoralis laceianus], two house mice, and a rock squirrel). Seroprevalence based on indirect immunofluorescence antibody testing was higher for both woodrats (37%) and raccoons (90%), compared with the Chagas Stat-Pak. This is the first report of T. cruzi in a hispid cotton rat, black rat, rock squirrel, and white-ankled mouse. These data indicate that based on culture and PCR testing, the prevalence of T. cruzi in woodrats is comparable with other common reservoirs (i.e., raccoons and opossums) in the United States. However, unlike raccoons and opossums, which tend to be infected with a particular genotype, southern plains woodrats were infected with TcI and TcIV at near equal frequencies."
Cytological and molecular detection of Leishmania infantum in different tissues of clinically normal and sick cats,"Natural infection of domestic cats by Leishmania infantum (synonym: L chagasi) has been demonstrated in several European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and the estimated prevalence of infection, based mainly on blood PCR, ranges from 0.3% up to 60.6%. In this study we aimed to: (a) estimate the prevalence of the infection by L. infantum in clinically normal cats (group A; n = 50) and in cats with various clinical signs (group B; n = 50), living in an endemic region, by both cytological examination of four different tissues (lymph node, skin, bone marrow, and conjunctiva) and by PCR in four different tissues (blood, skin biopsies, bone marrow, and conjunctiva); (b) compare the diagnostic sensitivity of the above methods and evaluate for possible associations between their results; and (c) investigate the possible associations between infection by L. infantiim and signalment, living conditions, season of sampling, and health status of the cats. The prevalence of the infection in the study population was 41% and did not differ (P=0.839) between group A (42%) and B (40%) cats. Lymph node, skin, bone marrow and conjunctiva cytology was always negative. Therefore, the diagnosis of the infection was based only on PCR in blood, skin biopsy, bone marrow and conjunctiva, which was positive in 13%, 18.2%, 16% and 3.1% of the cats, respectively. PCR was positive in only one of the four tissues in 80.5% of the infected cats. The results differed (P=0.014) among the four tissues and were less frequently positive in conjunctiva compared to skin biopsies and bone marrow (P=0.007 for both comparisons), thus highlighting the need for multiple tissue PCR testing in order to minimize false-negative results. More PCR-positive cats were found when sampling was performed during the period of sandfly activity (odds ratio: 2.44; P=0.022). Also, in group B cats, the likelihood of PCR-positivity was higher (odds ratio: 3.93; P=0.042) among those presenting at least one systemic clinical sign that had been previously reported in cats with leishmaniosis.

"Incidence, biochemical and haematological alterations induced by natural trypanosomosis in racing dromedary camels",
PREVALENCE OF HAEMOPROTOZOAN INFECTIONS IN PYRETIC DAIRY ANIMALS OF EASTERN HARYANA,"The examination of stained blood smears from pyretic cross bred cows (3041) and buffaloes (3122) of Eastern Haryana from July, 2003 to June 2010 revealed significantly higher infection in cows (27.88%) than buffaloes (0.6%). The pyretic cross-bred cows had Theileria annulata (22.88%) Trypanosoma evansi (0.33%), Babesia bigemina (3.22%) and Anaplasma marginale (1.45%) whereas buffaloes (3122) had T.evansi (0.32%) and B. bigemina (0.32%) only. Percentage of pyretic cows detected positive for T.annulata, B.bigemina and A.marginale was high from 2006-09 (27.6 to 32.8%), 2007 09 (3.91 to 5.60%) and 2006-10 (0.87 to 2.7s0%), respectively. Seasonwise T.annulata and B.bigemina were recorded in higher percentage of cross-bred cows during summer (9.7 and 1.6%) and rainy season (9.2 and 1.1%). Lower values of haemoglobin, packed cell volume and total erythrocytic counts in haemoprotozoan infected cross bred cows revealed anemia. The results of these observations suggest proper diagnosis of pyretic animals before undertaking therapeutic measures."
PREVALENCE OF Trypanosoma evansi IN CAMELS THROUGH POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION AND HAEMATOCRIT CENTRIFUGATION TECHNIQUE IN PUNJAB (PAKISTAN),"Prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection among camels in Punjab (Pakistan) was studied using haematocrit centrifugation technique (HCT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two different primer pairs (one specific for T. evansi and the other for T. brucei) were used. Among 100 camels of either sex and all ages from different localities of Punjab, the prevalence was 4% by haematocrit centrifugation technique, 9% with PCR primer-1 and 13% with primer-2. The observations establishes evidence of the usefulness of PCR as a diagnostic tool for epidemiological studies."
Epidemiology of Trypanosoma evansi infection in crossbred dairy cattle in Malaysia,"An investigation into the epidemiology of Trypansoma evansi infection in crossbred dairy cattle was conducted for a period of 12 months on a dairy cattle farm in Penninsular Malaysia. The prevalence of parasitaemia was highest in lactating animals (13.4%), followed by those in the dry herd (8.8%), late pregnant animals (8.1%), early pregnant animals (4.7%), calves (0.3%) and heifers (0.2%). The prevalence of antigenaemia was highest in the lactating animals (54.7%), followed by that in dry animals (53.7%), heifers (51.1%), late pregnant animals (47.7%), early pregnant animals (46.5%) and calves (24.2%)."
"Natural infection of Algerian hedgehog, Atelerix algirus (Lereboullet 1842) with Leishmania parasites in Tunisia","In Tunisia, Leishmania parasites are responsible of visceral leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania infantum species while three cutaneous disease forms are documented: chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania killicki, sporadic cutaneous form (SCL) caused by L infantum and the predominant zoonotic cutaneous leishmanaisis (ZCL) due to Leishmania major. ZCL reservoirs are rodents of the Psammomys and Meriones genera, while for SCL the dog is supposed to be a reservoir. Ctenodactylus gundii is involved in the transmission of L. killicki. However, other mammals could constitute potential reservoir hosts in Tunisia and other North African countries. In order to explore the role of hedgehogs as potential reservoirs of leishmaniasis, specimens (N= 6) were captured during July-November period in 2011-2013 in an SCL endemic area in El Kef region, North-Western Tunisia. Using morphological characteristics, all specimens were described and measured. Biopsies from liver, heart, kidney and spleen of each animal were used to extract genomic DNA, which was further used in PCR assays to assess the presence of Leishmania parasites. Different PCRs targeting kinetoplast minicircles, ITS1, mini-exon genes and a repetitive Leishmania- specific sequence, were applied. To further identify Leishmania species involved, RFLP analysis of amplified fragments was performed with appropriate restriction enzymes. Using morphological characters, animals were identified as North African hedgehogs, also called Algerian hedgehogs, that belong to the Erinaceidae family, genus Atelerix Pomel 1848, and species algirus (Lereboullet, 1842). PCR results showed in total that all specimens were Leishmania infected, with different organs incriminated, mainly liver and spleen. Results were confirmed by direct sequencing of amplified fragments. Species identification showed that all specimens were infected with L major, three of which were additionally co-infected with L. infantum. The present study demonstrates, for the first time in Tunisia, natural infection of hedgehog animals (Atelerix algirus) by the Leishmania parasites species L major and L. infantum. L. major is also detected for the first time in wild animals captured in the North Western part of the country; likewise for the co-infection of these animals by the 2 Leishmania species. This mammal could play a potential reservoir role in epidemiology of SCL or ZCL and could contribute to emergence or extension of ZCL in the studied region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Disease conditions of camels in now traditional camel keeping areas of Kajiado district in Kenya: A case study,"A cross sectional study was undertaken in a non-traditional camel keeping area of 3 divisions of Kajiadodistrict in Kenya to identify the quantify camel diseases, Three hundred and forty seven camels were examined. Blood and faecal samples were collected from all the camels for laboratory examination for haemoparasites, anaemia and helminthes. Trypanosomiasis, helmithosis, abscesses, mange and tick infestation, were the most prevalent diseases, The point prevalence of Trypanosomiasis was 7.8%. The point prevalence of helminth infestations was 52.7%, with a mean egg count per gram faeces of 163.4. Tick infestations was observed in 186 (53.6%), abscesses in 38 (11%) and mange in 32 (9.2%) camels. Diarrhoea, eye infections, wounds, mastitis, fracture, carpal joint deformity and facial nerve paralysis were also observed. It was concluded that camel diseases in the study area were similar to those reported in traditional environment, but are complicated by the presence of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomosis. Improvement in disease surveillance, control and management by the veterinary department and farmers is recommended so as to reduce the prevalence and consequences of disease in the district for further improving camel productivity."
Multi-locus characterization and phylogenetic inference of Leishmania spp. in snakes from Northwest China,"Background Leishmaniasis caused by protozoan parasite Leishmania is a neglected disease which is endemic in the northwest of China. Reptiles were considered to be the potential reservoir hosts for mammalian Leishmaniasis, and Leishmania had been detected in lizards from the epidemic area in the northwest of China. To date, few studies are focused on the natural infection of snakes with Leishmania. Methods In this study, 15 snakes captured from 10 endemic foci in the northwest of China were detected Leishmania spp. on the base of mitochondrial cytochrome b, heat shock protein 70 gene and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 regions, and identified with phylogenetic and network analyses. Result In total, Leishmania gene was found in 7 snakes. The phylogenetic inference trees and network analysis suggests that the species identification was confirmed as Leishmania donovani, L. turanica and L. (Sauroleishmania) sp. Conclusion Our work is the first time to investigate the natural Leishmania spp. infection of snakes in the northwest of China. Mammalian Leishmania (L. donovani and L. turanica) was discovered in snakes and the reptilian Leishmania (Sauroleishmania sp.) was closely related to the clinical strains both prompt the importance of snakes in the disease cycle. To indicate the epidemiological involvement of snakes, a wide sample size in epidemic area and the pathogenic features of reptilian Leishmania promastigotes are recommended in the future research."
"Seasonal prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in a tsetse-infested zone and a tsetse-free zone of the Amhara Region, north-west Ethiopia","During a period of four consecutive years, trypanosomosis surveys were conducted in a tsetse-infested and tsetse-free area of the Amhara Region of north-west Ethiopia. In each study area randomly selected communal cattle were sampled and their blood was investigated using parasitological diagnostic methods. At the same time the population of biting flies was sampled. The monthly average prevalence of trypanosome infections in cattle did not differ significantly between study areas. In both study areas, the prevalence of trypanosome infections was highest during the long rainy season. Trypanosome infections were mainly due to Trypanosoma vivax and they significantly reduced the average packed cell volume and the body condition of the animals. The monthly prevalence of infection was correlated with the density of biting flies, such as Tabanidae and Stomoxys spp., in the preceding month suggesting an important role of mechanical transmission in the epidemiology of trypanosomosis in both areas."
"A comparative longitudinal study of bovine trypanosomiasis in tsetse-free and tsetse-infested zones of the Amhara Region, northwest Ethiopia","A study was conducted to determine the incidence of trypanosome infections in cattle in tsetse-free and tsetse-infested zones of the Amhara Region of northwest Ethiopia. A total of six sentinel herds were established and the cattle observed during a period of 8 consecutive months. The prevalence of seropositive cattle was high in both the tsetse-free and tsetse-infested zones. The average monthly incidence of trypanosome infection, determined using molecular diagnostic tools, was 20.9% and 25.7% in the tsetse-free and the tsetse-infested zones, respectively. In the tsetse-free, Trypanosoma vivax was responsible for 90.9% of the cattle trypanosome infections. In the tsetse-infested zone, Trypanosoma congolense and T. vivax contributed almost equally to the trypanosome infections in cattle. Trypanosome infection, regardless of species, resulted in anaemia as evidenced by a significant decrease in the packed cell volume of the infected animal. The outcome of this longitudinal study suggests that control of trypanosomiasis in the Amhara Region cannot be achieved by tsetse control alone. Supplemental measures to include drug therapy and biting fly control are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi in stray and pet dogs in Grenada, West Indies","American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is endemic to parts of South America and the Caribbean. Infected dogs are important in the epidemiology of the parasite as they can play a role in the transmission of the parasite to humans. A total of 399 dog sera (242 stray and 157 pet dogs) were examined for T. cruzi infection; using a qualitative immunochromatographic dipstick test, based on recombinant antigens specific for American trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma detect rapid test; InBios international, Inc., Seattle, Washington). Overall seroprevalence for T. cruzi was estimated at 10.5%(95% confidence interval: 7.5% to 13.5%); with stray dogs being significantly more affected (p<0.05, chi 2). Results from this study indicate that dogs in Grenada are moderately exposed to T. cruzi compared to other areas in the region."
"Cryptic Leishmaniosis by Leishmania infantum, a feature of canines only? A study of natural infection in wild rabbits, humans and dogs in southeastern Spain","An epidemiological study was carried out to investigate asymptomatic Leishmania infantum infection by PCR and ELISA in wild rabbits, humans and domestic dogs in southeastern Spain. Seroprevalence was 0% (0/36) in rabbits, 2% (13/657) in humans and 7% (14/208) in dogs. The prevalence of PCR-positives was 0.6% (1/162) in rabbits tested in a wide range of tissue samples, 2% (8/392) in humans analysed in blood samples and 10% (20/193) and 67% (29/43) in dogs analysed in blood and lymphoid tissue samples, respectively. Results suggest that wild rabbits have a very low risk of becoming chronically infected with L. infantum, and provide further evidence that cryptic L. infantum infection is widespread in the domestic dog population and is also present in a comparatively smaller proportion of healthy humans. The epidemiological and clinical implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Ehrlichia canis in a hospital canine population,"Background Ehrlichia canis (E canis) infection has been documented in a few small canine case series in Greece. However, there is limited information on the prevalence of exposure to, or the potential risk factors associated with E canis seroreactivity in a large native canine population. Objectives The objectives of this study were to evaluate E canis seroprevalence in dogs admitted to a veterinary teaching hospital, and to investigate the potential association between seropositivity and signalment, health status, the serologic assays used, and selected clinical and clinicopathologic abnormalities. Methods The medical records of 850 client-owned dogs, tested using three in-office serologic assays, were retrospectively reviewed. Results The E canis seroprevalence was significantly higher in sick (54.9%) compared with healthy (33.9%) dogs. Seropositivity differed significantly between the serologic assays used in this study (ImmunoComb vs SNAP 3Dx/SNAP 4Dx). Dogs presenting with bleeding tendencies, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and hyperproteinemia were more likely to be E canis seropositive, and the median hematocrit (HCT), white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and platelet values were significantly lower in seropositive compared with seronegative dogs. Conclusions A high E canis seroprevalence was documented in a canine population living in an endemic area. Selected clinicopathologic variables might be useful indicators of E canis exposure and could allow the prioritization of serologic testing in the clinical setting."
Prevalence of canine Trypanosomosis in and around Kolkata City,"Trypanosomosis caused by Trypanosoma evansi is an important haernaprotozoan infection occurring in the tropical and sub-tropical region of the world. There are few reports of natural infection with T evansi in dogs (Losos, 1986). Dogs are very susceptible and usually experience acute fatal infection with T. evansi (Mahmoud and Gray, 1980). One-year study was carried out with the objective of month wise, breed and sex wise prevalence of Trypanosomosis caused by T evansi in canine in Kolkata City."
Immuno-enzymatic evaluation of the recombinant TSSA-II protein of Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs and human sera: a tool for epidemiological studies,"The rTSSA-II (recombinant Trypomastigote Small Surface II) antigen was evaluated by ELISA to detect anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in sera from naturally infected dogs and humans. For this evaluation ELISA-rTSSA-II was standardized and groups were classified according to the results obtained through xenodiagnosis, ELISA and PCR. Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp), Kappa index (KI) and area under curve (AUC) were determined. The Se was determined by using 14 sera from dogs infected with T. cruzi VI (TcVI) whereas Sp was determined by using 95 non-chagasic sera by xenodiagnosis, ELISA-Homogenate and PCR. The performance of ELISA-rTSSA-II in dog sera was high (AUC = 0.93 and KI=0.91). The Se was 92.85% (1 false negative) and Sp was 100%. Two sera from dogs infected with TcI and 1 with TcIII were negative. For patients infected with T. cruzi, reactivity was 87.8% (36/41), there was only 1 indeterminate, and Sp was 100%. Fifty-four sera from non-chagasic and 68 sera from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis did not react with rTSS-II. ELISA-rTSSA-II showed a high performance when studying sera from naturally infected dogs and it also presented 100% Sp. This assay could be an important tool to carry out sero-epidemiological surveys on the prevalence of T. cruzi circulating lineages in the region."
A field study to estimate the prevalence of Trypanosoma equiperdum in Mongolian horses,"From May to July 2000, a cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of Trypanosoma equiperdum in the horse population of the central province (Tuv aimag) of Mongolia. On average, four herds were selected from each of the 29 aimag subdivisions (119 herds). From each herd, 10 horses were sampled in proportion to sex and age categories in the respective herds (1190 horses). Sera from 1122 horses were analysed for T equiperdum antibodies using two serological assays, the complement fixation test (CFT) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The crude estimate of the CFT and the ELISA seroprevalence was 7.6 and 6.7%, respectively. Concordance between the CFT and ELISA results was high (96%). The highest number of CFT positive animals was detected in one herd in Mongomorit (6/10), followed by herds in Bayandelger (5/10) and in Bayantsagaan (5/10). Poor body condition was significantly correlated with positive serological status in both CFT and ELISA. A history of abortion appeared to be a risk factor for both CFT and ELISA seropositivity. Blood samples of all horses belonging to herds with at least three (3/10) seropositive animals (CFT and/or ELISA) were analysed by light microscopy and by PCR using a Topanosoma (Trypanozoon) brucei specific primer pair. No trypanosomes or any other haemoparasites could be detected in Giemsa stained thin blood smears. Eight out of the 130 samples (6.2%) analysed by PCR gave positive signals. Seven out of the eight PCR positive horses were also serologically positive. One PCR (and ELISA) positive stallion from Mongonmorit showed emaciation, scrotal and preputial oedema and an oedematous skin plaque. From the serological and DNA-based results it is concluded, that trypanosome infections occur in horses in the Tuv aimag of Mongolia. Since at present neither serological nor DNA-based tests allow a subspecies specific identification within the subgenus Trypanozoon, no definitive diagnosis can be given for T equiperdum. Whether the examined herds are infected with T equiperdum or with T evansi, the causative agent of surra, remains an open question. However, based on the clinical findings, the negative parasitological results and the concentration of conspicuous seroprevalences in single herds, circumstantial evidence supports the existence of infections with the causative agent of dourine.

TRYPANOSOME INFECTIONS IN WARTHOGS (PHACOCHOERUS-AETHIOPICUS) IN THE GAMBIA,"The prevalence of trypanosome infections in warthogs (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) in The Gambia was found to be 11% of a sample of 62 animals. All isolates were identified as Trypanasoma simiae. Serological evidence indicated a higher level of exposure to T. simiae, but results were inconclusive for the presence of Trypanosoma congolense. The course of T. simiae infection in warthog piglets showed a rapidly rising parasitaemia, with a concomitant fall in packed cell volume, and resulted in a prolonged period of low-level parasitaemia. The same infections killed domestic piglets."
"TRYPANOSOMIASIS IN CATTLE IN GAMBIA - INCIDENCE, PREVALENCE AND TSETSE CHALLENGE","The incidence of trypanosome infections, measured by a Berenil Index in experimental herds of 10 Zebu and 10 N'Dama cattle, was compared with tsetse challenge and with the prevalence of parasitaemia in local N'Dama at three villages in Gambia. Tsetse challenge was more strongly correlated with the incidence of parasitaemia in the Zebu than in the N'Dama. There was a strong correlation between prevalence and incidence of infection in the N'Dama. There was no correlation, however, between prevalence of infection in cattle and tsetse challenge unless the data were offset by 3-5 months. The Berenil Index in the Zebu increased at about twice the rate as in the N'Dama under corresponding levels of challenge. It is concluded that whereas incidence of infection in susceptible animals is best measured independently, it can, under stable conditions, be inferred from an assessment of tsetse challenge."
"Impact of phlebotomine sand flies on US military operations at Tallil Air Base, Iraq: 1. Background, military situation, and development of a ""Leishmaniasis control program""","One of the most significant modern day efforts to prevent and control an arthropodborne disease during a military deployment occurred when a team of U.S. military entomologists led efforts to characterize, prevent, and control leishmaniasis at Tallil Air Base (TAB), Iraq, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Soon after arriving at TAB on 22 March 2003, military entomologists determined that 1) high numbers of sand flies were present at TAB, 2) individual soldiers were receiving many sand fly bites in a single night, and 3) Leishmania parasites were present in 1.5% of the female sand flies as determined using a real-time (fluorogenic) Leishmania-generic polymerase chain reaction assay. The rapid determination that leisbmaniasis was a specific threat in this area allowed for the establishment of a comprehensive Leishmaniasis Control Program (LCP) over 5 mo before the first case of leishmaniasis was confirmed in a U.S. soldier deployed to Iraq. The LCP had four components: 1) risk assessment, 2) enhancement of use of personal protective measures by all personnel at TAB, 3) vector and reservoir control, and 4) education of military personnel about sand flies and leishmaniasis. The establishment of the LCP at TAB before the onset of any human disease conclusively demonstrated that entomologists can play a critical role during military deployments."
Plight of the bumble bee: Pathogen spillover from commercial to wild populations,"Pathogen spread or 'spillover' can occur when heavily infected, domestic hosts interact with closely-related wildlife populations. Commercially-produced bumble bees used in greenhouse pollination often have higher levels of various pathogens than wild bumble bees. These pathogens may spread to wild bees when commercial bees escape from greenhouses and interact with their wild counterparts at nearby flowers. We examined the prevalence of four pathogens in wild bumble bee populations at locations near and distant to commercial greenhouses in southern Ontario, Canada. Bumble bees collected near commercial greenhouses were more frequently infected by those pathogens capable of being transmitted at flowers (Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi) than bees collected at sites away from greenhouses. We argue that the spillover of pathogens from commercial to wild bees is the most likely cause of this pattern and we discuss the implications of such spillover for bumble bee conservation.

Epidemiological and molecular investigation of resurgent cutaneous leishmaniasis in Sudan,
Detection of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum RNA in fleas and ticks collected from naturally infected dogs,"The occurrence of the insect vector (sand flies) with low rates of Leishmania infection, as well as autochthonous transmission in the absence of the natural vector in dogs, have been reported. These unexpected data suggest a hypothesis of other arthropods as a possible way of Leishmania transmission. The prevalence of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum in fleas and ticks collected from dogs with canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL), as well as parasite viability, were evaluated herein. The presence of L. (L.) infantum was assayed by PCR and ELISA in ectoparasites and biological samples from 73 dogs living in a Brazilian endemic area. As the occurrence of Leishmania DNA in ticks and fleas is expected given their blood-feeding habits, we next investigated whether parasites can remain viable inside ticks. PCR and ELISA confirmed that 83% of the dogs had CVL. Fleas and ticks (nymphs, male and female adults) were collected in 55% and 63% of the 73 dogs, respectively. Out of the 60 dogs with CVL, 80% harbored ectoparasites infected with L. (L.) infantum. The infection rates of the ectoparasites were 23% and 50% for fleas and ticks, respectively. The RNA analysis of the extract from ticks left in laboratory conditions during 7 to 10 days after removal from CVL dogs showed that parasites were alive. In addition, live parasites were also detected inside adult ticks recently molted in laboratory conditions. These findings indicate a higher infection rate of L. (L.) infantum in ticks and fleas, but they do not conclusively demonstrate whether these ticks can act as vectors of CVL, despite the fact that their rates were higher than those previously described in Lutzomyia longipalpis. The presence of viable L. (L.) infantum in ticks suggests the possible importance of dog ectoparasites in CVL dissemination."
"Survey of Feral Swine (Sus scrofa) Infection with the Agent of Chagas Disease (Trypanosoma cruzi) in Texas, 2013-14","Feral swine (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species and reservoir of numerous zoonotic pathogens in the US, and Texas leads the nation in the estimated population size of feral hogs. Texas also harbors enzootic transmission cycles of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, agent of Chagas disease. Given previous evidence that swine can serve as reservoirs of T. cruzi in Latin America and new evidence of triatomines (kissing bugs) feeding on swine in Texas, we measured the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in feral swine in Texas. From 2013 to 2014, we sampled blood and/or cardiac tissue from 78 feral swine across 14 Texas counties (seven with and seven without prior documentation of kissing bug occurrence) and used PCR and histopathology to detect T. cruzi infection. We determined an overall infection prevalence of 6% (3 of 54) based on PCR evaluation of cardiac tissue, and no blood samples were positive (n = 72). All three positive pigs were from counties where kissing bugs are documented. No T. cruzi amastigotes were noted on histopathology (n = 54). Sarcocysts were observed in 10 (18%) of the samples, five of which also had mild focal areas of degeneration and inflammatory cell infiltration. Eco-epidemiologic investigations can provide an assessment of contributions of feral hogs to maintenance of T. cruzi across a landscape to help protect human and animal health."
"Monitoring Trypanosoma cruzi infection in triatomines using PCR in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil","Introduction: The aim of the present study was to assess the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a method for detecting Trypanosoma cruzi infection in triatomines that had been previously determined by microscopic examination in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Methods: In total, 515 specimens were collected. Material from the digestive tract of each triatomine was analyzed for the presence of T. cruzi by microscopic examination and PCR using the 121/122 primer set. Results: Among the 515 specimens tested, 58 (11.3%) were positive by microscopy and 101 (19.61%) were positive by PCR and there was an association between the results of the techniques (chi(2) = 53.354, p = 0.001). The main species of triatomine identified was T sordida (95.5%) Conclusions: The use of PCR in entomological surveillance may contribute to a better assessment of the occurrence of T. cruzi in triatomine populations."
"Molecular characterization of haemoparasites infecting bats (Microchiroptera) in Cornwall, UK","The presence of haemoparasites from the Order Piroplasmida and the genera Bartonella and Trypanosoma was assessed in the blood of 60 bats, belonging to 7 species, inhabiting sites across Cornwall in southwest England. DNA extracted from macerated heart tissue was incorporated into taxon-specific polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and amplification products were sequenced as a means of identifying, or assigning an identity, to detected haemoparasites. A Piroplasmida species was detected in 6 Pipistrellus spp., whereas Bartonella infections were detected in 5 bats belonging to 4 different species. Trypanosoma dionisii was detected in I Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic inference from alignment of a partial I SS rRNA-encoding gene sequence of the pipistrelle-associated Piroplasmida species with homologous sequences available for other members of the Order indicated that this organism was unique but specifically related to members of the genus Babesia, a phylogeny that would be in keeping with the organism being Babesia vesperuginis. Alignment of partial citrate synthase gene sequences from the bat-associated bartonellae revealed 5 distinct genotypes that were probably derived from 2 distinct Bartonella species. The study demonstrates the utility of molecular methods for detecting haemoparasites in dead bats and provides, for the first time, tangible identities for bat-associated Babesia and Bartonella species."
"Seroepidemiology of Leishmania spp. in dogs residing in Telemaco Borba, Parana, Brazil","Leishmaniasis is an important metazoonosis caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania and has a heteroxenic life cycle involving invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Transmission occurs during the blood meal of infected phlebotomine sand flies in wild species, domestic animals, and humans. The dog is a reservoir for the parasite causing visceral leishmaniasis (VL), whereas in American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL), dogs are erratic hosts that are accidentally infected, as in humans. Dogs are considered an important indicator of the parasite and its vectors in the environment, thus highlighting the importance of diagnosis in these animals. This study aimed to assess the seroepidemiology of Leishmania spp. in dogs in the municipality of Telemaco Borba that were part of a castration campaign. Blood samples from 191 dogs were collected, and their owners were surveyed on various epidemiological variables. Serological analysis was performed using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and rapid immunochromatography (DPP (R)). Screening by IIF identified 13 (6.81%) positive animals, none of which were positive for the DPP (R) test, which is specific for VL. Statistical analysis of the questionnaire responses indicated a significant association between seropositivity and the presence of stacked or composting leaves in the backyard (p = 0.0498), forest areas (squares, woods, parks) near the residence (p = 0.0015), and poorly healing ulcerated or nodular epidermal lesions in the dog (p = 0.0138). This study revealed the presence of anti-Leishmania spp. IgG antibodies in dogs residing in Telemaco Borba, suggesting the presence of the parasite and vector in the environment. In addition, the existence of stacked or composting leaves in the backyard, forest areas near the residence, and epidermal lesions in dogs are factors associated with Leishmania spp. infection in pet dogs."
"Serosurvey for Leishmania spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Neospora caninum in neighborhood dogs in Curitiba-Parana, Brazil","Neighborhood dogs may act as reservoirs for several zoonotic protozoan infections, particularly in urban areas, thus constituting a potential public health threat. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the exposure of neighborhood dogs to four protozoan pathogens in public areas with high levels of human movement in Curitiba, southern Brazil. Blood samples from 26 neighborhood dogs were screened by means of the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for Leishmania spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Neospora caninum, and a questionnaire was answered by the respective keeper. A total of 8/26 dogs (30.7%) seroreactive to T. gondii, 3/26 (11.5%) to N. caninum and 2/26 (7.7%) to both were identified. All the samples were seronegative for T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. Pathogen seroreactivity was not associated with the daily human movements or other epidemiological variables investigated (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the low seroprevalence for T. gondii and N. caninum indicated low environmental and food risk for animal infection and the seronegativity for Leishmania spp. and T. cruzi may reflect the absence of these pathogens in urban areas of Curitiba. Moreover, neighborhood dogs may be used as environmental sentinels for the presence of protozoan pathogens and their vectors."
A comparative molecular and 3-dimensional structural investigation into cross-continental and novel avian Trypanosoma spp. in Australia,"Background: Molecular and structural information on avian Trypanosoma spp. throughout Australia is limited despite their intrinsic value in understanding trypanosomatid evolution, diversity, and structural biology. In Western Australia tissue samples (n = 429) extracted from 93 birds in 25 bird species were screened using generic PCR primers to investigate the diversity of Trypanosoma spp. To investigate avian trypanosome structural biology the first 3-dimensional ultrastructural models of a Trypanosoma spp. (Trypanosoma sp. AAT) isolated from a bird (currawong, Strepera spp.) were generated using focussed ion beam milling combined with scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM). Results: Here, we confirm four intercontinental species of avian trypanosomes in native Australian birds, and identify a new avian Trypanosoma. Trypanosome infection was identified in 18 birds from 13 different bird species (19%). A single new genotype was isolated and found to be closely related to T. culicavium (Trypanosoma sp. CC2016 B002). Other Trypanosoma spp. identified include T. avium, T. culicavium, T. thomasbancrofti, Trypanosoma sp. TLAQ.22, Trypanosoma sp. AAT, and an uncharacterised Trypanosoma sp. (group C-III sensu Zidkova et al. (Infect Genet Evol 12:102-112, 2012)), all previously identified in Australia or other continents. Serially-sectioning Trypanosoma sp. AAT epimastigotes using FIB-SEM revealed the disc-shaped kinetoplast pocket attached perpendicular to the branching mitochondrion. Additionally, the universal minicircle sequence within the kinetoplast DNA and the associated binding protein were determined in Trypanosoma sp. AAT. Conclusions: These results indicate that bird trypanosomes are relatively conserved across continents, while being locally diverse, which supports the hypothesis that bird trypanosomes exist as fewer species than described in the literature. Evidence exists that avian Trypanosoma spp. are infecting mammals and could be transmitted by haemadipsid leeches. Trypanosoma sp. AAT is most likely a separate species currently found only in Australia and the first 3-dimentional ultrastructural analysis of an avian trypanosome provides interesting information on their morphology and organelle arrangement."
Interspecific geographic distribution and variation of the pathogens Nosema bombi and Crithidia species in United States bumble bee populations,"Several bumble bee (Bombus) species in North America have undergone range reductions and rapid declines in relative abundance. Pathogens have been suggested as causal factors, however, baseline data on pathogen distributions in a large number of bumble bee species have not been available to test this hypothesis. In a nationwide survey of the US, nearly 10,000 specimens of 36 bumble bee species collected at 284 sites were evaluated for the presence and prevalence of two known Bombus pathogens, the microsporidium Nosema bombi and trypanosomes in the genus Crithidia. Prevalence of Crithidia was <= 10% for all host species examined but was recorded from 21% of surveyed sites. Crithidia was isolated from 15 of the 36 Bombus species screened, and were most commonly recovered from Bombus bifarius, Bombus bimaculatus, Bombus impatiens and Bombus mixtus. Nosema bombi was isolated from 22 of the 36 US Bombus species collected. Only one species with more than 50 sampled bees, Bombus appositus, was free of the pathogen; whereas, prevalence was highest in Bombus occidentalis and Bombus pensylvanicus, two species that are reportedly undergoing population declines in North America. A variant of a tetranucleotide repeat in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the N. bombi rRNA gene, thus far not reported from European isolates, was isolated from ten US Bombus hosts, appearing in varying ratios in different host species. Given the genetic similarity of the rRNA gene of N. bombi sampled in Europe and North America to date, the presence of a unique isolate in US bumble could reveal one or more native North American strains and indicate that N. bombi is enzootic across the Holarctic Region, exhibiting some genetic isolation.

Infections of Hypostomus spp. by Trypanosoma spp. and leeches: a study of hematology and record of these hirudineans as potential vectors of these hemoflagellates,"Among Kinetoplastida, the Trypanosoma is the genus with the highest occurrence infecting populations of marine fish and freshwater in the world, with high levels of prevalence, causing influences fish health and consequent economic losses, mainly for fish populations in situation stress. This study investigated infections of Hypostomus spp. by Trypanosoma spp. and leeches, as well as blood parameters of this host in the network of tributaries of the Tapajos River in the state of Para, in the eastern Amazon region in Brazil. Of the 47 hosts examined, 89.4% were parasitized by Trypanosoma spp. and 55.4% also had leeches attached around the mouth. The intensity of Trypanosoma spp. increased with the size of the host, but the body conditions were not influenced by the parasitism. The number of red blood cells, and hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), total number of leukocytes and thrombocytes showed variations and negative correlation with the intensity of Trypanosoma spp. in the blood of the hosts. The results suggest that the leeches were vectors of Trypanosoma spp. in Hypostomus spp."
"Canine visceral leishmaniosis in Anasticio, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil","Canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL) may be an important factor preceding human outbreaks of the disease. We report that the prevalence of canine visceral leishmaniosis infection has been increasing in recent years in Anastacio town, located in the central western region of Brazil. Serological investigations showed that 75.3% of dogs presented antibody titres ranging from 1/40 to 1/160 in the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Bone marrow and lymph node aspirates provided positive cultures and furnished parasites for enzymological and serological typing in 42.5% and 41.1% of the cases, respectively. All the strains were typed as Leishmania (L.) chagasi. This is primarily a canine disease that spills over into the human population as a zoonosis. The study showed the epidemiological features of the infection in a region in which the problem of visceral leishmaniosis has been underestimated."
Risk factors for canine leishmaniasis in an endemic Mediterranean region,"Human visceral leishmaniasis is an emergent/re-emergent parasitic zoonotic disease in Europe caused by Leishmania infantum, with domestic dog as its main reservoir host. This study presents the results of a canine epidemiological survey in a mediterranean region where human and canine leishmaniasis (CanL) are endemic - Portugal. The main goal was to identify risk factors, which can be relevant for Leishmania infection control. The national survey was carried out in January 2009 with a screening of 3974 dogs from all 18 districts of mainland Portugal. Direct Agglutination Test was used for the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies in canine blood. An overall CanL true prevalence of 6.31% was observed. Apparent prevalence at district level ranged from 0.88% to 16.16%, with the highest prevalence in the interior regions. Identified risk factors for positivity were: dogs of 2 years and older (adjusted odds ratio OR = 5.39); spending exclusively/most of the time outdoors (OR = 2.51); origin from the interior of Portugal in comparison to littoral/coast districts (OR = 2.51); not having long fur (OR = 2.03); and being pure exotic (OR = 1.67). The results confirm the leishmaniasis endemicity in Portugal and the dynamic character of prevalence as new foci emerged and old foci lost their importance. The dog's age, fur size, district and living outdoors as opposed to indoors were more important than dog breeds and insecticide treatment in the transmission of Leishmania infection. The future of CanL prevention and control rely on an integrated approach involving veterinarians, dog owners and health authorities in order to reduce the canine infection risk and consequently, the human zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis.

"Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida Trypanosomatidae): Ecology of the transmission cycle in the wild environment of the Andean valley of Cochabamba, Bolivia","An active Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycle maintained by wild rodents in the Andean valleys of Cochabamba Bolivia is described. Wild and domestic Triatoma infestans with 60% infection with T. cruzi were found and was evidenced in 47.5% (rodents) and 26.7% (marsupial) by parasitological and/or serologycal methods. Phyllotis ocilae and the marsupial species Thylamys elegans, are the most important reservoirs followed by Bolomys lactens and Akodon boliviensis. In spite of both genotypes (TCI and TCII) being prevalent in Bolivia, in our study area only T. cruzi I is being transmitted. Our data suggest that wild T. infestans and wild small mammals play an important role in the maintenance of the transmission cycle of T. cruzi. Furthermore, the finding of high prevalence of T. cruzi infection in wild T. infestans point to the risk of the dispersion of Chagas' disease. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Frequency and factors associated with Theileria equi, Babesia caballi and Trypanosoma evansi in equids from Bahia (Northeast Brazil)","The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and factors associated to Babesia caballi, Theileria equi and Trypanosoma evansi in naturally infected equids from the northeast Brazil. Blood samples from 569 equids (528 horses, 8 mules, and 33 donkeys) were collected and tested for the presence of DNA of each of these protozoan parasites by PCR. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate risk factors associated with the infection. The frequency of T. equi infection was 83.5% (475/569) - 84.3% in horses, and 73.2% in donkeys and mules. The results of the final model indicated that age (senior group) and animal species (mule and donkey group) were protective factors against this pathogen. The frequency of B. caballi infection was 24.3% (138/569) - 23.5% in horses and 34.1% in donkeys and mules. Age (adult and senior group) was considered a protective factor against B. caballi infection whereas animal species (donkey and mule group) were considered a risk factor for the infection. Trypanosoma evansi infection was not detected in any of animals. Our results suggest that equids from the area studied may be infected earlier in life with the etiological agents of equine piroplasmosis and become asymptomatic carriers."
"Seroprevalence and risk factors for cattle anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and trypanosomiasis in a Brazilian semiarid region","The seroprevalence of Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina, Babesia bovis and Trypanosoma vivax and the risk factors for these infections were investigated in 509 cows on 37 farms in the semiarid region of Paraiba, northeastern Brazil. Cow serum samples were tested by means of immunofluorescence assay (IFA) against each specific antigen. The mean seroprevalence values per farm were 15.0% (range: 0-75%) for A. marginale, 9.5% (range: 0-40%) for B. bigemina and 26.9% (range: 0-73.7%) for B. bovis. All cows tested negative for T. vivax. Higher prevalence for A. marginale was significantly associated with less frequent acaricide spraying per year and with higher use of injectable antihelminthics. Presence of cows positive for B. bigemina was significantly associated with acaricide use and with presence of horse flies on the farm. Both occurrence and higher prevalence of B. bovis were significantly associated with recent observations of ticks on cattle. Overall, the present results indicate that the region investigated is an enzootically unstable area for A. marginale, B. bigemina and B. bovis, since most animals were seronegative to at least one agent."
"Impact of insecticide-treated bednets and indoor residual spraying in controlling populations of Phlebotomus duboscqi, the vector of Leishmania major in Central Mali","Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an endemic neglected tropical disease prevalent in several areas where seasonal malaria transmission is active. We assessed the effect of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and the mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets (LLINs) for malaria control on sand fly population diversity and abundance, and its impact on the risk of Leishmania transmission in the district of Baroueli, endemic for CL in Mali. Methods: Kemena and Sougoula, two villages in the district of Baroueli, were selected for entomology surveys from March to September 2016 to evaluate sand fly species composition and density, and Leishmania infection rates in the vector Phlebotomus duboscqi. The surveys followed an annual indoor residual spraying and mass distribution of longlasting insecticide-treated bednets (IRS/LLINs) that began in 2011 for malaria vector control. We also carried out a leishmanin skin test (LST) survey in the two villages to determine the incidence of Leishmania infection in humans living in the endemic area. Results: A total of 2936 sand fly specimens, 1013 males and 1923 females, were collected and identified from the two villages throughout the study period. Fourteen species, 2 belonging to the genus Phlebotomus and 12 to the genus Sergentomyia, were documented. The genus Sergentomyia constituted 91% of collected sand flies versus 9% for the genus Phlebotomus (P. duboscqi and P. rodhaini). Of those, P. duboscqi was the most abundant, representing 99.6% of the collected Phlebotomus species. In both villages, P. duboscqi was most abundant during the end of dry season (June). The prevalence of Leishmania infection in individual females of P. duboscqi by PCR was 3.5%. After 5 years of the IRS/LLINs, the incidence of Leishmania infection in the human population as measured by LST was 4.2%. Conclusions: Compared to historical data collected from 2005-2008, a considerable reduction was observed in both sand fly density and prevalence of human Leishmania infection in the villages of Kemena and Sougoula, Baroueli District, following IRS/LLINs. This suggests that IRS/LLINs used for mosquito control also impacts sand fly vectors reducing the incidence of leishmaniasis."
PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH INFECTION BY LEISHMANIA INFANTUM IN DOGS FROM AN URBAN AREA OF BRAZIL IDENTIFIED BY MOLECULAR METHODS,
Participation of Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Acari : Ixodidae) in the epidemiology of canine visceral leishmaniasis,"The vectorial competence of the tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus is discussed in relation to the epidemiology of canine visceral leishmaniasis, taking into account its strict association with dogs and the low indices of natural infection presented by its known vector, the phlebotomine sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. In order to evaluate natural infection by Leishmania chagasi and the infectivity of these parasites in the tick, 39 specimens (6 females, 11 males and 22 nymphs) of R. sanguineus were removed from 21 dogs showing diverse symptoms of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL). Six ticks (15.4%) gave positive results for the genus Leishmania using the PCR technique. To determine the infectivity of the parasites, 36 hamsters were inoculated orally and peritoneally with macerates of ticks removed from nine dogs symptomatic for visceral leishmaniasis. After 6 months the hamsters were sacrificed and necropsied. Serum was removed for IFAT, as well as spleen and liver fragments to make imprint smears and for PCR. Eight (88.9%) of these dogs presented ticks that were infective for 14 hamsters (41.2%), 12 (85.7%) of them infected peritoneally and two (14.3%) orally. PCR revealed 27 smears (40.9%) to be positive, 20 (62.5%) of them infected peritoneally and seven (20.6%) orally. IFAT showed 14 positive animals (41.2%). Based on these findings, we suggest that the vectorial capacity of R. sanguineus for L. chagasi should be evaluated further, opening new perspectives in the epidemiology of ZVL.

Serological Study of Selected Vector-Borne Diseases in Shelter Dogs in Central Spain Using Point-of-Care Assays,"We evaluated the prevalence of selected vector-borne diseases in 131 dogs in an animal shelter in central Spain using point-of-care assays (SNAP 4DX and SNAP Leishmania; IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME). The SNAP 4DX detects Dirofilaria immitis (Di) antigen and antibodies against Ehrlichia canis (Ec), Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), and Anaplasma phagocytophylum (Aph); the SNAP Leishmania kit detects antibodies against Leishmania infantum (Li). Dogs were classified as healthy or sick based on physical examination, complete blood counts, and serum chemistry profiles. The prevalence of positive test results was as follows: Ec, 5.3% (n = 7); Aph, 19.0% (n = 25); Bb, 0%; Di, 0%; and Li, 5.3% (n = 7). Four dogs (3%) were coexposed to Ec and Aph, and three dogs (2.3%) were coexposed to Aph and Li. There was no statistically significant correlation between positive serology and clinical status (sick vs. healthy) or hematologic/biochemical abnormalities. The prevalence of Aph was the highest and is in agreement with a recent report in a dog shelter in northwestern Spain. These point-of-care assays may be more valuable as epidemiologic than as clinical tools."
Infectious agent screening in canine blood donors in the United Kingdom,"Objectives Transfusion of blood products is an important component of veterinary emergency medicine. Donors must be carefully selected to minimise risk of transmission of blood-borne infectious agents. This study was devised to assess the prevalence of such agents in healthy, non-travelled UK dogs screened as prospective donors. Methods Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood samples from dogs donating blood between August 2007 and January 2012 were screened by polymerase chain reaction for haemotropic mycoplasmas, Bartonella, Babesia, Leishmania, Ehrlichia and Anaplasma spp. Dogs with positive or inconclusive results underwent repeat polymerase chain reaction testing. Results Four of 262 dogs had positive or inconclusive results at initial screening. Repeat polymerase chain reaction testing in each dog was negative, and none of the dogs developed clinical signs of disease. Clinical Significance The positive results on initial screening may have represented false positives from sample contamination or amplification of non-target DNA. It is also possible that dogs were infected at initial sampling but successfully cleared infection before repeat testing. The low number of positive results obtained suggests that prevalence of these agents in a population of healthy UK dogs is low and that use of blood products is unlikely to represent a significant risk of transmission of these diseases."
Serological survey of Neospora caninum and Leishmania infantum co-infection in dogs,"A seroprevalence survey and risk analysis of Neospora caninum and Leishmania infantum was conducted in dogs from an area of the Campania region of southern Italy, in order to investigate the co-infection of these two protozoa. Blood samples were collected from 1058 asymptomatic dogs over a 18 months period. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to N. caninum and to L. infantum using the indirect fluorescent antibody test. Epidemiological data (breed, age, sex, and utilization) were collected and statistically analysed in relation to N. caninum and to L. infantum seropositivity and antibody titres. Out of the 1058 sera samples tested, 68 (6.4%) were found to have antibodies to N. caninum, and 222 (21.0%) to have antibodies to L. infantum. The co-presence of antibodies to N. caninum and to L infantum was found in 46 (4.3%) dogs. Thus, 67.6% of the dogs positive for N. caninum also had antibodies to L. infantum. The major risk factor for N. caninum seropositivity was the presence of antibodies to L. infantum, and the major risk factor for L. infantum seropositivity was the presence of antibodies to N. caninum. In addition, high N. caninum seroprevalence was closely correlated to Boxer breed, and high L. infantum seroprevatence was correlated to masculine gender and Setter and Pit bull breeds. Low L. infantum seroprevalence was closely correlated to Yorkshire breed. The findings of this survey indicate that in the Campania region of southern Italy the co-presence of antibodies to N. caninum and to L infantum is very common in dogs, and that infection by one protozoan seems to enhance the susceptibility to the other one. This is probably due to the immunological status of the tested dogs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
Infected dogs as a risk factor in the transmission of human Trypanosoma cruzi infection in western Venezuela,"A total of 565 mongrel dogs from rural localities of Venezuela were examined by serological (DAT, IFAT and ELISA) and parasitological tests to address the status of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and to evaluate their role in the transmission of the infection to human population. The overall percentage of sero-positive infected dogs shown to be 67.6% (382/565):253 (61.7%) from 47 villages belonging to 8 states located at 4 different geographical regions of western Venezuela and 129 (33.5%) dogs from 48 households located in areas where Chagas disease is endemic. From 101 sampled dogs living in close proximity to 30 acute chagasic patients, 84% expressed specific anti-T cruzi antibodies (Ab) with 12 of them (14%) showing blood circulating parasites (BCP). In these houses a high proportion of sero-positive people (20%) and frequent indoor infestation by triatomine-bugs (70%) was also recorded. The analysis revealed that from the 47 rural villages sampled during the study, 91.5% had the presence of T cruzi sero-positive dogs, ranging from 62% positive localities at the states of Falcon and Cojedes to 100% in the other six studied Venezuelan states. This demonstrates that T cruzi-infected dogs are found throughout all the geographical regions of western Venezuela irrespective of their ecological differences. Molecular typing of T cruzi isolates from infected dogs using ribosomal and mini-exon gene markers, revealed the presence of both T cruzi I and T cruzi 11 lineages. The coincidence in the circulation of T cruzi II in dog and human populations at the same locality and at the same time is reported and its significance is discussed. The combined serological, parasitological, epidemiological and molecular data is gathered here to call the attention on the presence of infected dogs as a risk factor in the maintenance of T cruzi as a source for infection to humans.

"The triatomines of northern Peru, with emphasis on the ecology and infection by trypanosomes of Rhodnius ecuadoriensis (Triatominae)","Information on the distribution and synanthropic behaviour of triatomines is essential for Chagas disease vector control. This work summarises such information from northern Peru, and presents new data on Rhodnius ecuadoriensis - an important local vector infesting 10-35% of dwellings in some zones. Three species are strongly synanthropic and may be suitable targets for chemical control of domestic/peridomestic bug populations. Panstrongylus herreri, the main domestic vector in the area, is probably present in sylvatic ecotopes in the Maranon river system. R. ecuadoriensis and Triatoma dimidiata seem exclusively domestic,- biogeographical and ecological data suggest they might have spread in association with humans in northern Peru. Confirmation of this hypothesis would result in a local eradication strategy being recommended. Presence of trypanosome natural infection was assessed in 257 R. ecuadoriensis; Trypanosoma rangeli was detected in 4% of bugs. Six further triatomine species are potential disease vectors in the region (T. carrioni, P. chinai, P. rufotuberculatus, P. geniculatus, R. pictipes, and R. robustus), whilst Eratyrus mucronatus, E. cuspidatus, Cavernicola pilosa, Hermanlentia matsunoi, and Belminus peruvianus have little or no epidemiological significance. A strong community-based entomological surveillance system and collaboration with Ecuadorian public health authorities and researchers are recommended."
"Epidemiologic aspects of an outbreak of Trypanosoma vivax in a dairy cattle herd in Minas Gerais state, Brazil",
Illuminating the Prevalence of Trypanosoma brucei s.l. in Glossina Using LAMP as a Tool for Xenomonitoring,"Background As the reality of eliminating human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) by 2020 draws closer, the need to detect and identify the remaining areas of transmission increases. Here, we have explored the feasibility of using commercially available LAMP kits, designed to detect the Trypanozoon group of trypanosomes, as a xenomonitoring tool to screen tsetse flies for trypanosomes to be used in future epidemiological surveys. Methods and Findings The DNA extraction method was simplified and worked with the LAMP kits to detect a single positive fly when pooled with 19 negative flies, and the absolute lowest limit of detection that the kits were able to work at was the equivalent of 0.1 trypanosome per ml. The DNA from Trypanosoma brucei brucei could be detected six days after the fly had taken a blood meal containing dead trypanosomes, and when confronted with a range of non-target species, from both laboratory-reared flies and wild-caught flies, the kits showed no evidence of cross-reacting. Conclusion We have shown that it is possible to use a simplified DNA extraction method in conjunction with the pooling of tsetse flies to decrease the time it would take to screen large numbers of flies for the presence of Trypanozoon trypanosomes. The use of commercially-available LAMP kits provides a reliable and highly sensitive tool for xenomonitoring and identifying potential sleeping sickness transmission sites."
Pathogens of Wild Maned Wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) in Brazil,"The maned wolf, Chrysocyon brachyurus, is an endangered Neotropical canid that survives at low population densities. Diseases are a potential threat for its conservation but to date have been poorly studied. We performed clinical evaluations and investigated the presence of infectious diseases through serology and coprologic tests on maned wolves from Galheiro Natural Private Reserve, Perdizes City, Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. Fifteen wolves were captured between 2003 and 2008. We found high prevalences of antibody to canine distemper virus (CDV; 13/14), canine parvovirus (CPV; 4/14), canine adenovirus type 2 (13/14), canine coronavirus (5/11), canine parainfluenza virus (5/5), and Toxoplasma gondii (6/8), along with Ancylostomidae eggs in all feces samples. Antibodies against Leishmania sp. were found in one of 10 maned wolves, and all samples were negative for Neospora caniman. Evidence of high exposure to these viral agents was also observed in unvaccinated domestic clogs from neighboring farms. High prevalence of viral agents and parasites such as CDV, CPV, and Ancylostomidae indicates that this population faces considerable risk of outbreaks and chronic debilitating parasites. This is the first report of exposure to canine parainfluenza virus in Neotropical free-ranging wild canids. Our findings highlight that canine pathogens pose a serious hazard to the viability of maned wolves and other wild carnivore populations in the area and emphasize the need for monitoring and protecting wildlife health in remaining fragments of the Cerrado biome."
Serologic evidence of Leishmania infection in free-ranging wild and domestic canids around a Brazilian National Park,"Transmission of disease between wildlife, domestic animals, and humans is of great concern to conservation issues and public health. Here we report on the prevalence of anti-Leishmania sp. antibodies in 21 wild canids (7 Chrysocyon brachyurus, 12 Cerdocyon thous, and 2 Lycalopex vetulus) and 74 free domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) sampled around the Serra do Cipo National Park. In dogs, the apparent prevalence was 8.1% and in wild canids it was 19% (2 crab-eating foxes, C. thous, and 2 maned wolves, C. brachyurus). Management of the domestic dog population with evaluation of incidence changes in humans and wildlife, and enlightenment on the role of wild,reservoirs are essential issues for future action and research."
"Parasitic interactions among Trypanosoma cruzi, triatomine vectors, domestic animals, and wildlife in Big Bend National Park along the Texas-Mexico border","National parks attract millions of visitors each year. Park visitors, employees, and pets are at risk of infection with various zoonotic pathogens, including Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas disease. Big Bend National Park is located along the Texas-Mexico border in a region with endemic triatomine insects- vectors of T. cruzi- yet the degree to which the parasite is transmitted in this region is unknown. We collected triatomines for T. cruzi detection and discrete typing unit (DTU) determination, and conducted blood meal analyses to determine recent hosts. As an index of domestic/peridomestic transmission, we tested residential dogs in the Park for exposure to T. cruzi. From 2015 to 2017, 461 triatomines of three species-Triatoma rubida, Triatoma gerstaeckeri, and Triatoma protracta-were collected in and around the Park. Adult triatomine encounters peaked in June of each year (52.8% of collections). We detected an overall infection prevalence of 23.1% in adult triatomines (n = 320) and 4.2% in nymph triatomines (n = 24). DTU TcI was the only T. cruzi strain detected. Of 89 triatomines subjected to blood meal analyses, vertebrate host DNA was successfully amplified from 42 (47.2%); blood meal sources included humans, domestic animals, and avian and mammalian wildlife species. Tested dogs were considered positive if reactive on at least two independent serologic assays; we found 28.6% seroprevalence in 14 dogs. These findings reveal interactions between infected triatomines, humans, dogs, and wildlife in and around Big Bend National Park, with potential risk of human disease."
"Trypanosoma cruzi (Agent of Chagas Disease) in Sympatric Human and Dog Populations in ""Colonias"" of the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas","The zoonotic, vector-borne parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease throughout the Americas, but human and veterinary health burdens in the United States are unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional prevalence study in indigent, medically underserved human and cohabiting canine populations of seven south Texas border communities, known as colonias. Defining positivity as those samples that were positive on two or more independent tests, we found 1.3% seroprevalence in 233 humans, including one child born in the United States with only short-duration travel to Mexico. Additionally, a single child with no travel outside south Texas was positive on only a single test. Among 209 dogs, seroprevalence was 19.6%, but adjusted to 31.6% when including those dogs positive on only one test and extrapolating potential false negatives. Parasite DNA was detected in five dogs, indicating potential parasitemia. Seropositive dogs lived in all sampled colonias with no difference in odds of positivity across age, sex, or breed. Colonia residents collected two adult Triatoma gerstaeckeri and one nymph triatomine from around their homes; one of three bugs was infected with T. cruzi, and blood meal hosts were molecularly determined to include dog, human, and raccoon. Dogs and the infected vector all harbored T. cruzi discrete typing unit I, which has previously been implicated in human disease in the United States. Colonias harbor active T. cruzi transmission cycles and should be a priority in outreach and vector control initiatives."
Seasonal dynamics and co-occurrence patterns of honey bee pathogens revealed by high-throughput RT-qPCR analysis,"The health of the honey bee Apis mellifera is challenged by introduced parasites that interact with its inherent pathogens and cause elevated rates of colony losses. To elucidate co-occurrence, population dynamics, and synergistic interactions of honey bee pathogens, we established an array of diagnostic assays for a high-throughput qPCR platform. Assuming that interaction of pathogens requires co-occurrence within the same individual, single worker bees were analyzed instead of collective samples. Eleven viruses, four parasites, and three pathogenic bacteria were quantified in more than one thousand single bees sampled from sixteen disease-free apiaries in Southwest Germany. The most abundant viruses were black queen cell virus (84%), Lake Sinai virus 1 (42%), and deformed wing virus B (35%). Forager bees from asymptomatic colonies were infected with two different viruses in average, and simultaneous infection with four to six viruses was common (14%). Also, the intestinal parasites Nosema ceranae (96%) and Crithidia mellificae/Lotmaria passim (52%) occurred very frequently. These results indicate that low-level infections in honey bees are more common than previously assumed. All viruses showed seasonal variation, while N. ceranae did not. The foulbrood bacteria Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius were regionally distributed. Spearman's correlations and multiple regression analysis indicated possible synergistic interactions between the common pathogens, particularly for black queen cell virus. Beyond its suitability for further studies on honeybees, this targeted approach may be, due to its precision, capacity, and flexibility, a viable alternative to more expensive, sequencing-based approaches in nonmodel systems."
"The shadows of a ghost: a survey of canine leishmaniasis in Presidente Prudente and its spatial dispersion in the western region of Sao Paulo state, an emerging focus of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil","Background: Visceral leishmaniasis is an emerging zoonosis and its geographic distribution is restricted to tropical and temperate regions. Most of the individuals infected in Latin America are in Brazil. Despite the control measures that have been adopted, the disease is spreading throughout new regions of the country. Domestic dogs are involved in the transmission cycle and are considered to be the main epidemiologic reservoir of Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi). Our aim was to determine the prevalence of canine leishmaniasis (CL) and Ehrlichiosis infection in Presidente Prudente as well as the spatial dispersion of the disease in the western region of Sao Paulo state. Methods: Dogs underwent clinical examination and symptoms related to CL were recorded. Anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected using ELISA, rK39-immunocromatographic tests (DPP), and an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Anti-E. canis antibodies were detected by IFAT. A follow-up was conducted in dogs that were positive in the ELISA at the baseline study. Data on the spatial distribution of L. longipalpis and CL in Sao Paulo state were obtained from Brazilian public health agencies. Results: Serum samples from 4547 dogs were analyzed. The seroprevalence of CL was 11.2 % by ELISA and 4.5 % by IFAT. In the follow-up, seroprevalence was 32.9 % by ELISA, 15.3 % by IFAT, 11.8 % by DPP test, and 66.5 % for E. canis. There was a significant positive association between Leishmania and E. canis infection (P < 0.0001). In the follow-up, clinical examinations revealed symptoms compatible with CL in 33.5 % of the dogs. L. longipalpis was found in 24 and CL in 15 counties of the Presidente Prudente mesoregion. The dispersion route followed the west frontier of Sao Paulo state toward Parana state. Conclusions: Low CL and high ehrlichiosis prevalence rates were found in Presidente Prudente city. This emerging focus of CL is moving through the western region of Sao Paulo state toward the border of Parana state. Integrated actions to fight the vector, parasites, infected dogs, and humans are needed to monitor the disease and implement strategies for epidemiologic control."
Environmental Factors and Ecosystems Associated with Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis in Northeastern Brazil,"Environment influences the composition, distribution, and behavior of the vectors and mammalian hosts involved in the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), affecting the epidemiology of the disease. In Brazil, the urbanization process and canine cases of VL are indicators for local health authorities. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of the canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in MaranhAo State, Brazil. Blood samples collected from 960 dogs from six municipalities and six different ecosystems (Baixada Maranhense, Mangue, Mata dos Cocais, Amazonia, Cerrado, and Restinga) to serological tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], indirect fluorescence antibody test [IFAT], and chromatographic immunoassay methods [Dual Path Platform technology, DPP (R)]) and parasitological diagnosis. From serological tests, 11.14% (107) of the dogs were positive for CVL, with 59.16% (568), 14.5% (148), and 131% (126) positives to ELISA, DPP, and IFAT tests, respectively. Only seven animals (0.73%) were positive in a parasitological test. We also performed parasite isolation and phylogenetic characterization. All isolates of dogs obtained from MaranhAo were grouped in a single branch with Leishmania infantum chagasi from Brazil. The ecosystem Amazonia presented the highest positivity rates to CVL in serological and parasitological tests. Brazilian biomes/ecosystems suffer large degradation and may favor, depending on climatic conditions, the installation of new diseases. In the case of VL, dogs are reservoirs of parasites and sentinels for human infection."
"Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum chagasi Infection in Wild Mammals from Maranhao State, Brazil","Trypanosoma and Leishmania are obligate parasites that cause important diseases in human and domestic animals. Wild mammals are the natural reservoirs of these parasites, which are transmitted by hematophagous arthropods. The present study aimed to detect the natural occurrence of trypanosomatids through serological diagnosis, PCR of whole blood and blood culture (hemoculture), and phylogenetic relationships using small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), cytochrome b, and glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) genes. Samples from 131 wild animals, including rodents, marsupials, and bats, were sampled in six areas in the state of MaranhAo, in a transition zone of semiarid climates northeast of the equatorial humid Amazon. Serological analysis for Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi was performed in opossums by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and all animals were serologically negative. Nine positive hemocultures (6.77%) were isolated and cryopreserved and from mammals of the Didelphimorphia and Chiroptera orders and positioned in phylogenies on the basis of sequences from different genes with reference strains of Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei and T. cruzi. From primary samples (blood and tissues) only one bat, Pteronotus parnellii, was positive to SSU rDNA and gGAPDH genes and grouped with the L. infantum chagasi branch. The studies conducted in MaranhAo State provide knowledge of parasite diversity. It is important to determine the presence of trypanosomatids in wild mammals with synanthropic habits."

"Occurrence of Leishmania chagasi, Trypanosoma cruzi, Babesia canis vogeli, Anaplasma platys, and Ehrlichia canis in canine blood donors","The transfusion of blood components is common in a veterinary clinic; however, the safety of this therapeutic measure cannot always be guaranteed. Studies show a high risk of haemoparasite transmission during blood transfusion in canines. These parasites include Leishmania chagasi, Anaplasma platys, and Ehrlichia canis, which are endemic to the city of Cuiaba. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of L. chagasi, Trypanosoma cruzi, Babesia (canis) vogeli, A. platys, and E. canis in canine blood donor candidates, and identify possible factors associated with the infection of these agents. Sixty-six canines were evaluated using serologic and molecular tests, for the presence of the Leishmania species. While one canine sample showed a positive result for L. chagasi with indirect fluorescent antibody test, with titer of 1:40, and seven canine samples were positive using DPP, all other samples were negative when using PCR and ELISA. All canines were negative for T. cruzi when using PCR. The B. (c.) vogeli infection was identified in one canine and A. platys was identified in six canines. E. canis was identified in 17 canines, with a prevalence of 25.7%. There were no significant factors associated with the infection of the pathogens investigated. Given the observation of infection, even in the absence of clinical symptoms, emphasis must be placed on the need for the use of more sensitive and specific diagnostic methods for the screening of donor canines."
"Seroepidemiological aspects of Leishmania spp. in dogs in the Itaguai micro-region, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","This study evaluated factors associated with the frequency of Leishmania spp. antibodies in dogs residing in the Itaguai micro-region, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 524 dogs. The serum samples were submitted to indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Leishmania spp. The frequency of seropositive dogs was 28.24% (n = 148) in the micro-region, and among the three municipalities within that region, the highest frequency (p < 0.05) was observed in Seropedica (59.46%), followed by Itaguai (29.05%) and Mangaratiba (11.49%). Regarding factors associated with the host, mongrel dogs and those over the age of two presented higher frequency of antibodies to Leishmania spp. (p < 0.05). Concerning factors related to the environment and habits of the animal, dogs residing in rural areas (FR = 1.67, p = 0.0002), living outside the residence (FR = 1.42, p = 0.0197), with access to forest, streams and pastures (FR = 2.81, p = 0.0007), remaining loose (FR = 1.66, p = 0.0073), and those that had no shelter (FR = 2.16, p < 0.0001) were more likely to be seropositive. Canine leishmaniasis is a disease with high occurrence in the Itaguai micro-region, and aspects such as the definition of breed, age, habits and care by owners showed significant association in this micro-region."
Comparative evaluation of several methods for Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis diagnosis,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the serological methods using ELISA with recombinant-rK39 (ELISA-rK-39) and soluble extract-SE (ELISA-SE) antigens, the indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) in comparison to an immunochromatography rapid diagnostic test (RDT-rK39) and with a direct parasitological exam (PA) for Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL) diagnosis. The results showed that 89% (60/67) of the dogs were positive for at least one serological diagnostic test. ELISA-SE was the test that detected anti-Leishmania antibodies in the serum of the highest number of dogs (71.6%) followed by ELISA-rK39 (65.7%), IFAT (65.7%) and RDT-rK39 (55.2%). PA detected the lowest numbers (40.3%) of positive dogs. In relation to the total of examined dogs, the Kappa indexes (p=0.05) showed a good agreement between ELISA-SE and IFAT (88.1%; k=0.7237), and it was also observed in the comparison of RDT-rK39 with ELISA-SE (83.6%, k=0.6561), IFAT (83.5%, k=0.6605) and PA (85.0%, k=0.7074). A bad agreement was detected in any association of ELISA-rk39 with the other tests in either symptomatic or asymptomatic animals. ELISA as well as RDT using recombinant antigenic protein (rK39) were the methods that detected the lowest prevalence rates (33.3%) of CVL in asymptomatic dogs. In conclusion, only one test does not adequately identify dogs with CVL and it is necessary the association of two or more diagnostic tests. Because of the good agreement indexes of RDT-rK39 when evaluated with ELISA-SE, IFAT and PA it was suggested as a complementary method to be used in association with either ELISA-SE or IFAT, particularly in the symptomatic dogs. Furthermore, new studies are recommended in order to improve the sensitivity of tests mainly for asymptomatic dogs."
Multiple Approaches to Address Potential Risk Factors of Chagas Disease Transmission in Northeastern Brazil,"Chagas disease is one of the most significant systemic parasitosis in Latin America, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which is mainly transmitted by hematophagous insects, the triatomines. This research was carried out in both domestic and wild environments throughout a Northeastern rural locality. Triatomines were captured in both peridomicile and wild environments, obtaining 508 specimens of triatomines, of which 99.6% were Triatoma brasiliensis. Insects were captured in 10 (18.5%) peridomiciles with an average of 8.3 triatomines per residence. Triatoma brasiliensis nymphs and adults were found in six peridomiciles, generating a 11.1% colonization. No T. cruzi infection was detected in the 447 peridomestic insects analyzed. On the other hand, of the 55 sylvatic T. brasiliensis molecularly examined for T. cruzi, 12 (21%) were positive, all harboring T. cruzi I. The blood meal analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from gut content revealed that both peridomestic and wild triatomine populations fed mainly on birds, refractory to the parasite, which may explain the null rate of natural infection prevalence in the domestic environment. However, infected triatomines for potential home infestation within the radius of insect dispersion capacity were registered in rock outcrops around the dwellings. Anthropogenic environmental influences are able to rapidly alter these scenarios. Therefore, to avoid disease transmission to humans, we recommend constant vector control combined with periodic serological surveillance. The associated methodology presented herein may serve as a model for early detections of risk factors for Chagas disease transmission in the Brazilian Northeast."
Canine vector-borne diseases in Brazil,"Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are highly prevalent in Brazil and represent a challenge to veterinarians and public health workers, since some diseases are of great zoonotic potential. Dogs are affected by many protozoa (e.g., Babesia vogeli, Leishmania infantum, and Trypanosoma cruzi), bacteria (e.g., Anaplasma platys and Ehrlichia canis), and helminths (e.g., Dirofilaria immitis and Dipylidium caninum) that are transmitted by a diverse range of arthropod vectors, including ticks, fleas, lice, triatomines, mosquitoes, tabanids, and phlebotomine sand flies. This article focuses on several aspects (etiology, transmission, distribution, prevalence, risk factors, diagnosis, control, prevention, and public health significance) of CVBDs in Brazil and discusses research gaps to be addressed in future studies."
Seroepidemiological survey on canine leishmaniasis among dogs from an urban area of Brazil,"A cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey on canine leishmaniasis among pet dogs was carried out in an urban area in the State of Pernambuco (Brazil) where human cases of visceral leishmaniasis have sporadically been reported. Using an indirect fluorescent antibody test, anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected in 130 out of 322 dogs, confirming previous exposure to Leishmania parasites. The overall seroprevalence found was 40.3% (95% confidence interval: 34.9-45.9). Data analysis revealed that serological positivity was statistically associated with male (chi(2) = 20.60, P-value = 0.000) and juvenile dogs (chi(2) = 4.24, P-value = 0.039). Furthermore, it was observed that 85.3% of all seropositive dogs showed no clinical signs of leishmaniasis. The results showed a high seroprevalence of anti-Leishmania antibodies among dogs from an urban area of Pernambuco - with a large proportion of asymptomatic seropositive dogs - indicating that the prevalence of Leishmania infection in this area has been underestimated.

Cutaneous and visceral leishmaniosis in dogs from a rural community in northeastern Brazil,"A community-based epidemiological study was carried out in a rural area in northeastern Brazil, where visceral leishmaniosis is endemic, but the primary vector Lutzomyia longipalpis has never been found. Forty-one dogs were screened by an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) for the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies and 12(29.3%) of them were positive. One of the IFAT-positive dogs was also positive for Leishmania amastigotes in bone marrow cytology and for Leishmania infantum by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on blood. One IFAT-negative dog was positive for L infantum by PCR on bone marrow and other for Leishmania amastigotes in skin stained-smears. When tested for L. braziliensis by PCR, 20 dogs were positive. Considering all diagnostic tests, the estimated prevalence of Leishmania spp. infection in the studied rural dog population was 58.5%. There was no significant difference in IFAT-positivity in relation to age, gender, and clinical status of the dogs. When tested for L. infantum by real-time PCR, 20 ticks collected from IFAT-positive dogs were all negative. This study shows a high level of exposure to Leishmania spp. infection in dogs from a rural community in northeastern Brazil. In general, the results do not support the participation of ticks as vectors of L infantum in this area, which is likely to be transmitted by Lutzomyia spp. other than L longipalpis. Finally, this study highlights that the use of IFAT in areas where both L infantum and L. braziliensis are present should be withdraw in order to avoid the unnecessary culling of dogs that are actually infected only by L braziliensis.

The evaluation of GM6-based ELISA and ICT as diagnostic methods on a Mongolian farm with an outbreak of non-tsetse transmitted horse trypanosomosis,"Trypanosoma equiperdum, which is the etiological agent of dourine, spreads through sexual intercourse in equines. Dourine (T. equiperdum) has been reported in Mongolia, where it is considered an economically important disease of horses. T. evansi has also been reported in Mongolian domestic animals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential application of recombinant T. evansi GM6 (rTeGM6-4r)-based diagnostic methods on a farm with an outbreak of non-tsetse transmitted horse trypanosomosis. Ninety-seven percent homology was found between the amino acid sequences of T. equiperdum GM6 and the GM6 of another Trypanozoon, which also shared the same cellular localization. This finding suggests the utility of rTeGM6-4r-based serodiagnostic methods for epidemiological studies and the diagnosis of both surra and dourine in Equidae. Fifty blood samples were examined from a herd of horses. The diagnostic value of an rTeGM6-4r-based ELISA and an rTeGM6-4r-based immunochromatographic test (ICT) were measured in comparison to a T. evansi crude antigen-based ELISA, which is a diagnostic method recommended by the OIE. However, this is not a perfect diagnostic method for trypanosomosis. Positive serum samples were detected in 46%, 42% and 28% of the tested horses using an rTeGM6-4r-based ELISA, crude antigen-based ELISA and rTeGM6-4r-based ICT, respectively. The sensitivity of rTeGM6-based ELISA was 81%, the specificity was 79%, and the agreement was moderate. We conclude that rTeGM6-4r-based ELISA and ICT represent alternative options for baseline epidemiological studies and the on-site diagnosis of horse trypanosomoses in the field, respectively."
"Molecular Survey on Detection of Leishmania Infection in Rodent Reservoirs in Jahrom District, Southern Iran","Background: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is endemic in many parts of Iran. Recently its incidence is considerable in different parts of Jahrom district, in Fars Province, southern Iran. The aims of our study were to investigate the prevalence of leishmania infection, and identify and characterize the Leishmania species present, among the rodents by molecular methods in a new endemic focus of ZCL, in an urban and rural area of the Jahrom district, Fars Province, southern Iran. Methods: From May to November 2010), 55 rodents in four regions of Jahrom focus were caught and checked for leishmania infection by the microscopical examination of liver, spleen, ears, and footpads' smears. Results: Overall 18 Meriones persicus, 15 Tatera indica, 14 Mus musculus, and 8 Rattus rattus were caught. Totally, four (16.5%) and two (13.3%) of the Me. persicus and Ta. indica, but only one of Mu. musculus and Ra. rattus were found smear-positive for leishmania amastigotes, respectively. In the nested-PCR assay 8 (14.6%) smears were found positive for Leishmania major, none was found positive for any other Leishmania species. Sequencing based detection of Leishmania confirmed the microscopic and PCR findings. All positive specimens were shown 95-96% similarity with L. major Friedlin. Conclusion: Tatera indica and Me. persicus are incriminated as the main `reservoir' hosts of L. major in the rural area of Jahrom, moreover, Mu. musculus and Ra. rattus have the minor but remarkable role in the maintenance of the disease in the urban regions of Jahrom focus."
"The occurrence of Trypanosoma evansi in buffaloes in Indonesia, estimated using various diagnostic tests","The prevalence and incidence of Trypanosoma evansi infections in village buffaloes in Central Java were estimated using parasitological tests, two antigen-detection ELISAs (2G6 Ag-ELISA and Tr7 Ag-ELISA), an antibody-detection ELISA (IgG ELISA) and a card agglutination test (CATT). Of 2387 village buffaloes tested in five districts, 4% (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3 %, 5 %) were positive with the microhaematocrit test (MHCT), 58 % (95 % CI: 56 %, 60 %) were positive with the 2G6 Ag-ELISA and 70 % (95 % CI: 68 %, 72 %) were positive with the Tr7 Ag-ELISA. An increasing prevalence with age was found and the proportion of positive buffaloes was highest in the over 84 months-old age-group (68 %) with the 2G6 Ag-ELISA and in the 37-60 months-old age-group (78 %) with the Tr7 Ag-ELISA. Parasitaemic buffaloes were found in more than half of the villages visited. Corrected village-specific prevalence values obtained with the two Ag-ELISAs ranged from 0 % to over 100 %, and prevalence differed significantly (P less than or equal to 0.0001) between villages in four of the five districts. Overall, 10% of buffaloes tested in markets were found to be parasitaemic and 39, 56 and 47 % were found positive with the 2G6 Ag-ELISA, IgG ELISA and CATT, respectively. Incidence rates varied according to the test used and ranged from 0.22 (95 % CI: 0.09, 0.44) to 0.44 (95 % CI: 0.24, 0.76), per animal-year at risk, in two villages. The results highlight the importance of using validated diagnostic tests to obtain accurate estimates of prevalence and incidence. These parameters are needed, for example in mathematical models, for the development and evaluation of different control strategies for T. evansi infections in buffaloes."
Detection of Leishmania in Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from Southeastern France Using Real-time Quantitative PCR,"The role of red foxes in the natural cycle of Leishmania infection is not well known. In the Var area, southeastern France, from 2006 to 2012, we conducted a longitudinal epidemiologic survey of foxes using quantitative PCR. Among 92 red foxes screened, prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection was 9%. Red foxes may be considered a bioindicator of parasite circulation in this biotope."
Prevalence and incidence of bovine trypanosomosis in an agro-pastoral area of southwestern Burkina Faso,"The present study was conducted to determine the prevalence and incidence of trypanosomosis and to investigate some factors influencing them in an agro-pastoral area of southwestern Burkina Faso. A total of 363 crossbred cattle (Baoule-zebu peul), which were bred under natural trypanosomosis challenge, were monitored monthly for parasitaemia, packed cell volume (PCV) and serological analyses over 2 years. The parasitological prevalence estimated at the beginning of the survey using the buffy coat technique (BCT) was 7.54%. As much as 66.7% of all trypanosome infections were due to Trypanosoma vivax, 23.8% due to Trypanosoma congolense and 9.5% due to T. vivax/T. congolense mixed infections. The monthly serological incidence varied from 0.29% to 19.29%. The season was the most important factor influencing the serological prevalence and incidence and the animal PCV. The dry hot season is associated with increasing seroprevalences and incidences and consequently a decreasing average of PCV. In addition, an important spatial heterogeneity was observed.

"Seroepidemiological survey of canine leishmaniasis in endemic areas of Cuiaba, State of Mato Grosso","Leishmaniases are zoonoses that are undergoing expansion in Brazil. Dogs are of importance regarding transmission and dispersion of the disease, especially in areas presenting visceral leishmaniasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of leishmaniasis among domestic dogs in the urban area of Cuiaba. For this investigation, four districts of Cuiaba were selected, one in each administrative region. The dog sampling was defined statistically, taking the prevalence to be 8.4%. Among the 468 dogs examined, 16 presented an indirect immunofluorescence reaction, thus resulting in an overall prevalence of 3.4%. There was no predisposition towards canine leishmaniasis occurrences in relation to breed, sex or age. The main risk factors for occurrences of canine infection identified in the city of Cuiaba were the presence of dogs living in areas surrounding homes and the proximity of homes to forests. Thus, there have been changes in leishmaniasis occurrences within the urban environment."
"Prevalence and epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis in dogs and humans in the city Cuiaba, Mato Grosso, Brazil","Visceral leishmaniasis is an infectious disease endemic in several regions of Brazil, including the state of Mato Grosso. In Cuiaba, from January 2006 to December 2008, a research was performed in canine cases of infection with Leishmania sp. by serology and cytology, focusing on its geographical distribution, correlating to the occurrence of human visceral leishmaniasis cases. From 150 dogs with suspected infection, 57 (38%) were serological or parasitologically positive. Seroprevalence was observed (P <= 0.05) in districts with low per capita income, besides a larger number of canine cases in the East regional, but there was a diffuse distribution of the canine disease in the city of Cuiaba, in contrast to cases focused mainly on human in the northern municipality. This suggests risk throughout the municipality and further epidemiological studies should be carried out, as well as vector distribution, to promote better understanding of canine infection by Leishmania, in order to promote appropriate measures for disease control."
"Canine visceral leishmaniasis: seroprevalence and risk factors in Cuiaba, Mato Grosso, Brazil","In Brazil, canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is endemic and the number of cases in humans and dogs has increased in the Midwest region. A transversal study was carried out in endemic areas from Cuiaba, State of Mato Grosso, to assess data on seroprevalence and risk factors associated to canine infection. Four hundred and thirty (430) dogs were randomly evaluated through indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) considering variables related to the animals, the environment and the knowledge by owners on CVL aspects and control. From 430 dogs, 95(22.1%) were seroreagent for leishmaniasis and animals living in rural environments present risk 1.9 times higher for acquiring the disease than those in urban environments (p = 0.01; OR 1.9). Factors related to animals' habits, such as free access to the street and guard function were considered indicators to predict infection by Leishmania sp. (p < 0.05) by statistical univariate analysis. The presence of agricultural activities was also a fact that contributed for the insurgence of the infection (p = 0.02; OR 1.68). The results contributed to the knowledge on the aspects of CVL in Cuiaba and point to an urgent need to include educational and sanitary programs in the city, since the region presents favorable characteristics for spreading the infection of CVL as already observed in other Brazilian cities."
Factors Associated with the Seroprevalence of Leishmaniasis in Dogs Living around Atlantic Forest Fragments,"Canine visceral leishmaniasis is an important zoonosis in Brazil. However, infection patterns are unknown in some scenarios such as rural settlements around Atlantic Forest fragments. Additionally, controversy remains over risk factors, and most identified patterns of infection in dogs have been found in urban areas. We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiological survey to assess the prevalence of leishmaniasis in dogs through three different serological tests, and interviews with owners to assess features of dogs and households around five Atlantic Forest remnants in southeastern Brazil. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Chi-square tests to detect associations between prevalence and variables that might influence Leishmania infection, and a nearest neighbor dispersion analysis to assess clustering in the spatial distribution of seropositive dogs. Our findings showed an average prevalence of 20% (ranging from 10 to 32%) in dogs. Nearly 40% (ranging from 22 to 55%) of households had at least one seropositive dog. Some individual traits of dogs (height, sterilization, long fur, age class) were found to positively influence the prevalence, while some had negative influence (weight, body score, presence of ectoparasites). Environmental and management features (number of cats in the households, dogs with free-ranging behavior) also entered models as negative associations with seropositivity. Strong and consistent negative (protective) influences of the presence of chickens and pigs in dog seropositivity were detected. Spatial clustering of cases was detected in only one of the five study sites. The results showed that different risk factors than those found in urban areas may drive the prevalence of canine leishmaniasis in farm/forest interfaces, and that humans and wildlife risk infection in these areas. Domestic dog population limitation by gonadectomy, legal restriction of dog numbers per household and owner education are of the greatest importance for the control of visceral leishmaniasis in rural zones near forest fragments."
"Endosymbionts of Ctenocephalides felis felis (Siphonaptera : Pulicidae) obtained from dogs captured in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil","Specimens of fleas Ctenocephalides felis felis (1052 female/448 male), obtained from 150 dogs in Centro de Controle de Zoonoses de Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, were dissected and examined for endosymbionts. Three protozoan, Nolleria pulicis, a gregarine (Actinocephalidae) and Leptomonas sp., together with one cestode, Dipylidium caninum were identified. Infections by N. pulicis and Leptomonas sp. occurred mainly in the warm-rainy period. The prevalence and distribution of these enclosymbionts in fleas derived from Brazil and South America, and the their variation according to sex and season, are reported for the first time.

High seroprevalence and peripheral spatial distribution of visceral leishmaniasis among domestic dogs in an emerging urban focus in Central Brazil: a cross-sectional study,"The Brazilian municipality of Rondonopolis is an emerging urban focus of intense transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), where few investigations have addressed canine reservoirs. This study assessed the seroprevalence and spatial distribution of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in the urban area of Rondonopolis. A CVL serosurvey was conducted between October 2016 and February 2017 using an immunochromatographic rapid test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Domestic dogs were sampled from 25 heterogeneous regions previously defined by the Spatial 'K'Iuster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal algorithm, which considered the socioeconomic and environmental features from the last demographic census. The CVL spatial distribution was analyzed by kernel density estimation (KDE) and spatial scan statistic. All the autochthonous human VL cases reported between 2014 and 2016 were georeferenced. Of the 600 dogs tested, 115 were seropositive in both tests. The overall CVL prevalence was 19.2% (95%CI: 16.1-22.3%), which varied widely among the evaluated regions (0.0-35.1%). Almost 25% of the sampled households (n = 405) had at least one infected dog. KDE demonstrated that positive CVL households were concentrated in the peripheral areas of the city. Spatial scan statistics detected a spatial cluster with significantly low CVL prevalence in the central region (relative risk = 0.37; p = 0.04), where only one human VL case was reported. Thus, we demonstrated a high prevalence of CVL in domestic dogs from diverse socioeconomic and environmental urban contexts in Rondonopolis. The CVL cases were peripherally distributed and occurred more frequently in areas that had reported human VL."
"Phlebotomine sandfly species from an American visceral leishmaniasis area in the Northern Rainforest region of Pernambuco State, Brazil","The aim of this study was to identify the fauna of phlebotomine sandflies in an area with incidence of American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL) in Sao Vicente Ferrer, a municipality (county) located in the northern Zona da Mata in Pernambuco State, Brazil. Sandfly captures were conducted monthly for four nights/month from December 2002 to November 2003, by means of manual captures (with a Shannon trap) and by CDC light traps. A total of 23,156 specimens of phlebotomines sandflies were collected in a remnant of the Atlantic rainforest, houses, and animal shelters. Lutzomyia complexa was the most prevalent species, with a frequency of 62.5% (14,445/23,156), followed by Lutzomyia migonei, with 33.2% (7,677/23,156). No Lutzomyia longipalpis (the main vector of Leishmania chagasi in Brazil and the Americas) was found in the target area. Some specimens were dissected, but no Leishmania parasites were found."
"Natural Leishmania infantum infection in Migonemyia migonei (Franca, 1920) (Diptera:Psychodidae:Phlebotominae) the putative vector of visceral leishmaniasis in Pernambuco State, Brazil","A study of the natural infection of phlebotomine sand flies by Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum was conducted in an area of visceral leishmaniasis in Sao Vicente Ferrer, located in the northern part of the Atlantic rain forest region in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. In a previous study, Migonemyia migonei have been found predominantly in peridomiciles and houses in this endemic area. The analysis of M. migonei, collected by CDC light trap, by multiplex PCR assay coupled to non-isotopic hybridization showed that 2 females out of 50 were infected by L infantum. This is the first finding of natural infection of M. migonei by L infantum suggesting that M. migonei may be the vector of L. infantum in areas of visceral leishmaniasis where Lutzomyia longipalpis, the usual vector, is absent.

"Geographical variation in clinical signs and prevalence of Leishmania sp. infection among dogs in Fortaleza, Cear√° State, Brazil",
"High genetic diversity in a single population of Triatoma sanguisuga (LeConte, 1855) inferred from two mitochondrial markers: Cytochrome b and 16S ribosomal DNA","Chagas disease remains endemic across much of Latin America, but is largely enzootic - restricted to wild mammals and triatomine vectors in the United States. Within the United States, there are ten recognized species of triatomines and 18 mammals reported naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. However, only six cases of autochthonous vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi to humans have been reported in the United States. As a follow-up to the sixth reported case, triatomine insects were collected from the index case site, in a rural area of New Orleans, LA, USA. During the summer months of 2006 and 2007, 344 Triatoma sanguisuga were collected and showed a T. cruzi infection prevalence of 56%. A subset of these insects was analyzed to infer intraspecific genetic variation from a 606 bp fragment of cytochrome b (n = 54) and a 340 bp fragment of 16S ribosomal DNA (n = 17). From the 54 samples, 37 cytb haplotypes (H(d) = 0.978) were observed and 14.7% of positions were polymorphic. Phylogenetic analysis divides the population into two distinct groups with an average pairwise genetic distance of similar to 5%. The 16S rDNA sequences revealed 6 haplotypes among 17 specimens (H(d) = 0.713) with 1.2% of the positions exhibiting polymorphisms. 16S polymorphism data support the concept of two groups within this single population. The genetic distance of Group 1 from Group 2 suggests that Group1 could represent a sub-species as this level of divergence is similar to that observed among other triatomine subspecies.

Serodiagnosis of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in human and canine populations living in Indigenous Reserves in the Brazilian Amazon Region,"Introduction: Leishmaniasis is endemic to the Northern, Northeastern, Central-Western, and Southeastern regions of Brazil. We aimed to assess the epidemiological situation of leishmaniasis in humans and dogs in indigenous villages located in the States of Mato Grosso and Tocantins using a serological survey conducted in May 2011. Methods: Serum samples were collected from 470 humans and 327 dogs living in villages of the Urubu Branco and Tapirape Karaja indigenous reserves. The samples were analyzed for the presence of Leishmania spp. antibodies using the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a crude antigen (CA) and soluble antigen (SA), and Dual Path Platform (DPP (R)) immunoassay for canine visceral leishmaniasis. Results: Of 470 human samples tested, two (0.4%) were positive using IFAT. Among 327 dog samples tested, 28 (8.6%) were positive using ELISA CA, five (1.5%) using ELISA SA, two (0.6%) using IFAT, and none using DPP (R) immunoassay with Leishmania infantum chagasi antigen. When Leishmania amazonensis antigen was used, 20 (6.1%) samples were positive using ELISA CA and four (1.2%) using IFAT. Conclusions: There was a low prevalence of infection in the region, and significant differences among the main serological methods used for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. These findings indicated that the detection of Leishmania spp. requires further study and improvement."
Antibodies anti-trypanosomatides in domestic cats in Parana: who is at highest risk of infection?,"The aim of this study were to detect antibodies anti-Leishmania spp. and anti-Trypanosoma cruzi in two different populations of domestic cats (Felis catus domesticus) from North Parana referred for surgical castration and to determine which characteristics of the animals studied may be associated with seropositivity. Serum samples from 679 cats were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) in series. Associations between age, sex, race, year of care and animal group were verified using the simple logistic regression. Percentage of 8.5% (58/679) of cats were positive for Leishmania spp. and 7.6% (51/673) for T cruzi by the tests ELISA and IFAT. Animals collected by non-governmental animal protection organizations presented more seropositivity for Leishmania spp. (p<0.0001). Results shown that Leishmania spp. and T cruzi are present in domestic cats in the northern part of the state of Parana, as well as, owners of non-governmental animal protection organizations may be more exposed to leishmaniasis when compared to other animal owners evaluated in the present study."
Leishmania (infantum) chagasi in canine urinary sediment,"Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is difficult to diagnosis, mainly due to the presence of asymptomatic animals, the diversity of clinical symptoms and the difficulty in obtaining diagnostic evidence of high sensitivity and specificity. The purpose of this study was to diagnose CVL in urinary sediment of 70 dogs of different breeds, sexes and ages from the veterinary hospital of the Federal University of Piaui and Zoonosis Control Center of Teresina, Brazil. The serological tests were TR DPP (R) for CVL and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for CVL, parasitological exams of bone marrow and lymph nodes and urine sediment cultures. Leishmania was detected in the bone marrow and/or lymph node of 61.0% of the animals (43/70), and urine sediment culture was positive in 9.30% (4/43) of these animals. In the serological exams, 70.0% (49/70) were reactive using the DPP and 78.2% (55/70) were reactive using ELISA. The goal of this study was to diagnose the presence of L. (infantum) chagasi in a culture of urinary sediment."
Trypanosoma evansi in inbred and Swiss-Webster mice: distinct aspects of pathogenesis,"Trypanosoma evansi (Trypanosomatidae, Kinetoplastida) is a salivarian trypanosomatid that infects eight mammal orders spread over America, Europe and Asia. In Brazil, T. evansi is the etiological agent of ""Mal de Cadeiras"", a horse disease very often described in the region known as Pantanal do Mato Grosso. Few data concerning the genetic diversity and biology of subpopulations of T. evansi that circulate in Brazil are available. The factors that modulate the interaction of this parasite with its hosts also remain to be elucidated. Here we evaluated the course of experimental infection of six T. evansi isolates derived from domestic and wild animals in Swiss-Webster mice and three Mus musculus lineages. The follow-up included biological, immunological as well as biochemical and hematological parameters. The same isolates as well as three others were characterized by pulsed-field electrophoresis. Our results showed that T. evansi isolates displayed significant differences regarding behavior and morbidity patterns in the distinct mouse lineages. Nevertheless, these differences could not be correlated with pulsed-field electrophoresis profiles. Indeed, concerning this molecular marker, only microheterogeneity was observed. Moreover, we observed that the outcome of the infection is defined by both host genetic background and peculiarities (virulence factors) of the distinct T. evansi isolates. Anemia and hypoglycemia were the only features that could be observed in all mouse lineages, independently of the inoculated T. evansi subpopulation. In addition, our data also show that Mus musculus is a suitable model host for the study of the different pathogenetic features of T. evansi infection."
"Leishmania amazonensis DNA in wild females of Lutzomyia cruzi (Diptera: Psychodidae) in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil","Studies on natural infection by Leishmania spp of sandflies collected in endemic and nonendemic areas can provide important information on the distribution and intensity of the transmission of these parasites. This study sought to investigate the natural infection by Leishmania in wild female sandflies. The specimens were caught in the city of Corumba, state of Mato Grosso do Sul (Brazil) between October 2012-March 2014, and dissected to investigate flagellates and/or submitted to molecular analysis to detect Leishmania DNA. A total of 1,164 females (77.56% of which were Lutzomyia cruzi) representing 11 species were investigated using molecular analysis; 126 specimens of Lu. cruzi were dissected and also submitted to molecular analysis. The infection rate based on the presence of Leishmania DNA considering all the sandfly species analysed was 0.69%; only Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis was identified in Lu. cruzi by the molecular analysis. The dissections were negative for flagellates. This is the first record of the presence of L. (L.) amazonensis DNA in Lu. cruzi, and the first record of this parasite in this area. These findings point to the need for further investigation into the possible role of this sandfly as vector of this parasite."
"Seroprevalence and risk factors for canine visceral leishmaniasis in the endemic area of Dias D'Avila, State of Bahia, Brazil","Introduction: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important zoonosis in relation to public health systems. Dogs are the main domestic reservoir. This study aimed to investigate occurrences of canine VL in Dias D'Avila, State of Bahia, Brazil. Methods: The prevalence was evaluated by means of clinical and laboratory tests on a population of 312 domestic dogs from 23 localities in this municipality, using indirect immunofluorescence and immunoenzymatic assays. Results: Among the animals examined, 3.2% and 6.7% showed signs of VL, confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoenzymatic assays, respectively, with a distribution of 29.9% (24 dogs) in the rural zone and 4.9% (288 dogs) in the urban zone (p = 0.001). The clinical evaluation on seropositive dogs showed both asymptomatic animals (2.4%) and symptomatic animals (47.6%), along with other abnormalities (e. g. normocytic and normochromic anemia, with leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia). Observations relating to phenotypic characteristics (e. g. sex, age, breed and hair) did not present statistical significance, although high seropositivity among male, short-haired and mixed-breed dogs was observed. Conclusions: The findings showed that VL was a predominantly rural zoonosis and that close contact between poultry and domestic dogs significantly increased the risk of canine infection in this region."
"Seroepidemiology of Leishmania spp. in equids from Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil","This study evaluated the occurrence of Leishmania spp. in equids from Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. Serum samples from 257 healthy equids of Uberlandia were assessed for the presence of antibodies against Leishmania spp. by using the indirect fluorescent-antibody test. Additionally, an epidemiological survey was done to evaluate the possible risk factors (species of equids, age, gender, economic activity, and contact with domestic and wild animals) associated with the presence of antibodies against Leishmania spp. The total seroprevalence against Leishmania spp. was 24.1% (62/257); representing seroprevalence levels of 22.7% (55/242) in horses, 50% (4/8) in mules, and 42.9% (3/7) in ponies from all regions evaluated. The species of equid was the only factor that contributed to an elevated seroprevalence of Leishmania spp."
"First record of Trypanosoma sp (Protozoa: Kinetoplastida) in tuvira (Gymnotus aff. inaequilabiatus) in the Pantanal wetland, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil","The blood infection by Tiypanosoma sp. in tuvira (Gymnotus aff. inaequilabiatus) from the Pantanal wetland was reported in this study. Ten fish from the Paraguay River in the Pantanal were evaluated for the presence of hemoflagellates. Trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma sp. were observed in blood smears from three fish (30% prevalence) and some forms were seen to be undergoing division. Using the diagnostic methods of fresh examination and blood centrifugation in hematocrit capillary tubes, the prevalence rate was 80%. This is the first report of Trypanosoma sp. in tuvira in Brazil."
"Occurrence of positivity for Trypanosoma cruzi in triatomine from municipalities in Southeastern Brazil, from 2002 to 2004","Introduction: from an epidemiological point of view, more than 120 species of triatomine (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) are known. The occurrence and positivity for Trypanosoma cruzi in triatomines in 16 municipalities of the Triangulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba were evaluated from January 2002 to December 2004. Methods: the triatomines were captured basically according to the classic norms of the National Health Foundation. The parasitological exams of the triatomines were conducted according to the technique described by the Ministry of Health. During the study period, 990 specimens of triatomines were captured and of these, 771 could be examined. Results: five species were identified: Triatoma sordida, Panstrongylus diasi, Panstrongylus megistus, Panstrongylus geniculatus and Rhodnius neglectus. Triatoma sordida represented 71.5% of all the triatomines captured, followed by Panstrongylus megistus (18%), Rhodnius neglectus (9.3%), Panstrongylus diasi (0.8%) and Panstrongylus geniculatus (0.4%). Of the total number of triatomines examined, 2.7% were positive for Trypanosoma cruzi. Panstrongylus megistus was the species that presented the highest rates of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi (8.3%), followed by Rhodnius neglectus (2.9%) and Triatoma sordida (1.4%). Conclusions: there is a need to adapt to new circumstances in epidemiology, with greater emphasis on entomological surveillance, since the potential for adaptation of secondary species of triatomines exists, especially where Chagas' disease is already under control."
Detection of Leishmania spp. in Bats from an Area of Brazil Endemic for Visceral Leishmaniasis,"The multihost parasites Leishmania spp. infect a broad range of wild mammalian species including bats. Several species of bats have adapted to a variety of food resources and shelters in urban areas. This study aimed to detect Leishmania spp. DNA in bats present in forest fragments located in metropolitan areas endemic for leishmaniasis in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Brazil. Blood samples were obtained from 80 individuals, including eight species of Phyllostomidae and one species of Vespertilionidae. Thirty of the 80 bats were positive for Leishmania spp. using conventional PCR, all belonging to the family Phyllostomidae. Eighteen samples tested by real-time PCR (qPCR) using specific primers for the kDNA of Leishmania infantum were positive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report detecting Leishmania spp. in Platyrrhinus incarum in addition to being the first reported detection of L.infantum in the bat species Phyllostomus discolor, Platyrrhinus lineatus, Artibeus planirostris and Artibeus lituratus. Our results show that bats can host Leishmania spp. in areas endemic for leishmaniasis, which must be taken into account in disease control operations by public health authorities."
"Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum and Leishmania spp. serology and Leishmania spp. PCR in dogs from Pirassununga, SP","We examined the presence of antibodies against the parasites Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, and Leishmania spp., as well the presence of DNA from Leishmania spp., in dogs from Pirassununga - SP. The seropositivity rate was compared with the animals' originating location. Three hundred seventy-three blood samples from the county's kennel and local veterinary clinics were collected and analyzed. A total of 300 samples were tested for T. gondii and N. caninum using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT); 45% (135/300) were positive for T. gondii and 24.3% (73/300) were positive for N. caninum. Three hundred seventy-three samples were tested for Leishmania spp. using the IFAT. Of these, 4.6% (17/373) were positive. Additionally, 145 samples were tested using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR); of these samples, 0.7% (1/145) was positive. Considering the results, we conclude that these parasites are present in the city of Pirassununga - SP and that the animals have contact with the protozoan. It is therefore necessary to create methods for disease prevention to maintain both animal and human health in regard to leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis."
"Serological detection of Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania infantum and Neospora caninum in cats from an area endemic for leishmaniasis in Brazil","An investigation was made into the occurrence of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania infantum and Neospora caninum in 151 domestic cats, based on the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Serum samples were collected from 151 domestic cats (65 free-roaming and 86 domiciled cats; 55 males and 96 females) in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil between January and April 2013. IgG antibodies to T. gondii, L. infantum and N. caninum were found, respectively, in 49 (32.5%), 34 (22.5%) and 10 (6.6%) sampled cats. A positive correlation was found between T. gondii and N. caninum, T. gondii and L. infantum, and N. caninum and L. infantum (p < 0.05) infections. Also, a significant interaction was identified between gender and area of activity on the probability of T. gondii (p = 0.0324) infection. However, no significant interaction was observed between gender and area of activity on infections by either N. caninum or L. infantum. This study showed that cats from an area endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil are exposed to three different protozoans, two of which are causal agents of important zoonosis."
A survey of hemoparasite infections in free-ranging mammals and reptiles in French Guiana,"Blood smears of 1,353 free-ranging mammals (35 species) and 112 reptiles (31 species) from French Guiana were examined for hemoparasites. Parasites from 3 major groups were recorded: Apicomplexa (including hemogregarines, piroplasms, and Plasmodium spp.), Trypanosomatidae, and Filaroidea. Fifty percent of the individuals (86% of the species) were infected by parasites from at least 1 group. Hemogregarines, identified as Hepatozoon sp., infected numerous snakes with high prevalences (30-100%); infection is reported for the first time in 5 host genera of snakes: Clelia, Oxybelis, Pseustes, Rhinobotryum, and Bothriopsis. Infections were also observed in 4 marsupial species and 1 rodent. Hepatozoon spp. recorded in Didelphis albiventris (Marsupialia) and Coendou prehensilis (Rodentia) may be new species. Plasmodium sp. were observed in 2 snake species, Dipsas indica (Colubridae) and Bothrops atrox (Viperidae). Plasmodium brasilianum was recorded in all 5 primate species examined. Piroplasms were observed in all mammal orders except primates. Large terrestrial rodents were the main hosts of members of the Babesidae; 42% of Myoprocta acouchy, 36% of Dasyprocta agouti, and 44% of Agouti paca were infected. Trypanosomes were common in mammals and were recorded in 70% of the examined genera. Trypanosoma cruzi-like infections were reported in 21 mammal species, including sloths, rodents, carnivores, and primates. Microfilariae were also widespread, with higher prevalences in sloths, anteaters, and porcupines (>40% of the individuals infected) and in tamarins (95% infected). This survey highlights some potential anthropozoonotic risks due to the recent further evidence of Plasmodium brasilianum and P. malariae as a single species and to the increased diversity of hosts for Trypanosoma cruzi."
"Antibody occurrence of Anti-Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania sp and Ehrlichia canis in dogs in Bahia State","Toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis, and ehrlichiosis are zoonoses that have cosmopolitan distribution and cause important clinical changes in dogs and humans. Dogs are important in the epidemiology and transmission of Leishmania infantum and Ehrlichia canis and serve as indicators of environmental contamination by the transmission of Toxoplasma gondii. The aim of this study was to detect antibodies against T. gondii, Leishmania spp., and E. canis in dogs from Bahia and identify the risk factors associated with infections. Blood samples were collected from 353 dogs from several municipalities of Bahia and the sera were tested using reaction of indirect immunofluorescence (RIFI) for T. gondii and Leishmania spp. and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for E. canis. The data were tabulated and analyzed using EPI-INFO 7.1.5 program. Of 353 samples analyzed, 144 (40.8%) were positive for T. gondii (antibody titer 16-4,096) and 92 (26.1%) were seropositive for Leishmania spp. (antibody titer 40-160). The seropositivity for E. canis was the highest as compared to that of the other agents. Furthermore, 184 (52.1%) samples were positive for antibodies against E. canis. Sixteen (4.5%), 71 (20.1%), and 25 (7.1%) samples were co-infected with T. gondii and Leishmania spp., T. gondii and E. canis, and E. canis and Leishmania spp., respectively, while 20 (5.7%) dogs presented co-seropositivity for all three etiological agents. Risk factors such as age, sex, habitat (stray/not stray), and region of dog's origin were analyzed; age (>= 1 year) was significantly associated with T. gondii (p = 0.03) and E. canis (p = 0.02) infection and stray animals were more exposed to T. gondii (p = 0.03) and Leishmania spp. (p = 0.01) infection. The results confirmed the heterogeneous distribution of the three etiological agents in dogs from Bahia and identified animals with co-infections."
Trypanosoma cruzi Lineages Detected in Congenitally Infected Infants and Triatoma infestans from the Same Disease-Endemic Region under Entomologic Surveillance in Paraguay,"Trypanosoma cruzi II is associated with Chagas disease in the southern part of South America. We analyzed T cruzi variants in field-collected triatomines and congenitally infected infants living in the same disease-endemic region in Paraguay. Results of polymerase chain reactions for T cruzi kinetoplast DNA. and satellite DNA were positive in 83 triatomine feces samples and 58 infant blood samples. However, lineages were detected in 33 and 38 samples, respectively. Trypanosoma cruzi genotypes were determined in 56 (97%) blood samples after hybridization by using specific probes. The Tc I genotype was not detected. The prevalent sublineage was Tc IId in triatomines (27 of 33) and infant blood (36 of 58) as assessed by amplification of the 24S alpha ribosomal RNA and the mini-exon region genes. The Tc IIc genotype was detected in 20 infant blood samples and in 1 triatomine. This study shows T cruzi II is the predominant lineage circulating in triatomines and humans in endemic areas of eastern region of Paraguay."
Prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection and associated risk factors in camels in eastern Chad,"A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection (Surra) in herds of camels from the eastern area of Chad. The risk factors associated with disease were also identified. From August 1997 to April 1998, a random sample of 2831 camels from 136 herds was selected. Blood samples were collected and examined for the presence of T evansi using an antibody (card agglutination test-CATT/T evansi) and a parasite detection test (buffy-coat technique-BCT). Standardized questionnaires with information about the host and management practices were collected and evaluated for their association with seroprevalence (model 1) and parasitological prevalence (model 2) as indications of host sensitivity. In both models, risk factors were selected using ordinary logistic regression (OLR) and herd effect was evaluated using a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model. The apparent prevalence was 5.3% using BCT and 30.5% with CATT. Real prevalence was estimated at 16.9% +/- 1.4 (alpha = 5%). Overall, 27.9% (BCT) and 94.9% (CATT) of the herds had a least one-positive animal. Real herd prevalence was estimated at 42.6 +/- 8.3% (a = 5%). Camels of the large transhumants had the highest prevalence (estimated to 30.3% +/- 12.5; 62.9 +/- 12.0 in herds). Risk factors associated with seroprevalence were age, ethnic group, length of seasonal migration and longitude of pasture area in the dry season. Risk factors associated with BCT prevalence were age, length of seasonal migration, longitude of pasture area in the dry season, latitude of pasture area in the rainy season and season of sampling.

Epidemiology of Trypanosoma vivax infection in cattle in the tse-tse free area of Lake Chad,
The re-emergence of American visceral leishmaniasis in an old focus in Venezuela: Present situation of human and canine infections,"The report of a new autochthonous case of human American Visceral Leishmaniasis (AVL) in 1992 in the village of Guayabita, Aragua State. Venezuela (10 degrees 16'N, 67 degrees 28'W; 500 m asl), led us to undertake on epidemiological study in this locality. A demographic survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire in which data was collected regarding sex, age, occupation, length of residence in the area and migratory history. A leishmanin skin test (LST) was applied and samples of venous blood for counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) and immunofluorescent antibodies (IFAT) tests were drawn. The prevalence of positive LST was 11.4 %. The positivity was highest among males and increased with age. Young males seemed to be more exposed to infection than females. Since occupation per se did not seem to account for this association, it may be explained as a gender-associated behavior, leading to different degrees of exposure to sand flies. The canine population was also screened for leishmanial infection. One dog was shown to be parasitologically infected with leishmania sp. Four out of 71 dogs (5.6 %) were positive for FG, CIEP, IFAT and Western Blot and 11 (15.5 %) were positive for CIEP. These results suggest that after almost 30 years of epidemiological silence, American visceral leishmaniasis has reemerged in this focus."
"Natural Leishmania infection of Phlebotomus sergenti (Diptera: Phlebotominae) in an endemic focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Sanliurfa, Turkey","Sand flies (Diptera: Phlebotominae) were surveyed for Leishmania in various villages of Sanliurfa in southeast Turkey. A total of 474 sand flies were collected by CDC light traps. Phlebotomus sergenti Parrot (49.6%) and Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli) (48.1%) were the most abundant species, followed by Phlebotomus alexandri Sinton (1.05%), Phlebotomus perfiliewi Parrot (0.4%), Phlebotomus (Adlerius) sp. (0.2%) and Sergentomyia theodori Parrot (0.4%). 196 female sand flies were grouped in 34 pools of max 10 specimens each and 4 pools of P. sergenti were found positive for Leishmania DNA, detected by using ITS-1 primer set. This is the first molecular detection and identification of Leishmania tropica within naturally infected P. sergenti from the most important focus of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in Turkey. The high frequency of P. sergenti together with natural infection by the parasite makes this species the probable vector of L. tropica in Sanliurfa. The data obtained from this study could be used in strategic planning for the control of leishmaniasis in the region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Sodalis glossinidius prevalence and trypanosome presence in tsetse from Luambe National Park, Zambia","Background: Tsetse flies are the biological vectors of African trypanosomes, the causative agents of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals. The tsetse endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius has been suggested to play a role in tsetse susceptibility to infection. Here we investigate the prevalence of African trypanosomes within tsetse from the Luambe National Park, Zambia and if there is an association between S. glossinidius and presence of trypanosomes within the tsetse examined. Methods: Tsetse representing three species (Glossina brevipalpis, Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina pallidipes), were sampled from Luambe National Park, Zambia. Following DNA extraction, PCR was used to examine the tsetse for presence of trypanosomes and the secondary endosymbiont S. glossinidius. Results: S. glossinidius infection rates varied significantly between tsetse species, with G. brevipalpis (93.7%) showing the highest levels of infection followed by G. m. morsitans (17.5%) and G. pallidipes (1.4%). ITS-PCR detected a wide variety of trypanosomes within the tsetse that were analysed. Significant differences were found in terms of trypanosome presence between the three tsetse species. A high proportion of G. m. morsitans were shown to carry T. brucei s.l. DNA (73.7%) and of these around 50% were positive for Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. T. vivax, T. godfreyi, T. simiae, T. simiae Tsavo and T. congolense were also detected. No association was found between the occurrence of S. glossinidius and the presence of trypanosome DNA in any of the three tsetse species tested. Conclusion: The current work shows that T. b. rhodesiense was circulating in Luambe National Park, representing a risk for people living in the park or surrounding area and for tourists visiting the park. The differences in trypanosome DNA presence observed between the different tsetse species tested may indicate host feeding preferences, as the PCR will not discriminate between a fly with an active/resident infection compared to a refractory fly that has fed on an infected animal. This makes it difficult to establish if S. glossinidius may play a role in the susceptibility of tsetse flies to trypanosome infection."
INFECTIONS WITH ENDOPARASITES IN STRAY AND UNWANTED DOGS IN SOUTHERN SWITZERLAND,"At their entry into the animal domicile, ''La Stampa'', in Lugano (canton Tessin), 217 stray dogs and 154 unwanted dogs were examined for infections with intestinal parasites, filariae, Babesia and Leishmania. The following techniques were used for detection of intestinal parasites: combined sedimentation-flotation, MIFC technique and scotch tape adherence test. Prevalences of helminth egg excretion in stray dogs and in unwanted dogs, respectively, were as follows: 34% and 22% for Trichuris, 17% and 14% for Toxocam, 3% and 5% for hookworms, 4% and 0% for taeniids. Dipylidium, Toxascaris and Capillaria were diagnosed sporadically. Samples positive for taeniids were further tested for the presence of Echinococcus coproantigens in a sandwich ELISA: one of 9 dogs was strongly positive. This dog was euthanized for security reasons and upon dissection, 11 Taenia hydatigena and more than 10 000 gravid Echinococcus granulosus worms were found. Microfilariae were detected in the blood of 3 stray dogs and one unwanted dog by the Difil-test. In all ii cases the infective species was Dirofilaria immitis as confirmed by morphology acid phosphatase activity analysis of microfilariae and by detection of specific antigens in blood plasma by ELISA, Specific antibodies against antigen of Leishmania infantum could not be detected in any of these dogs by ELISA. However, 3 stray dogs had specific antibodies against antigen of Babesia canis as demonstrated by IFAT."
Canine leishmaniasis due to Leishmania infantum: Interest and realisation of the latex test. Ecoepidemiological applications,"The authors relate the realization, evaluation and eco-epidemiological applications of a ""field-test"": the agglutination of latex particles coated with a soluble antigen of Leishmania infantum in the presence of homologous antibodies. Evaluated on 1 035 canine sera, the sensitivity of the latex agglutination test (LAT) was 93.4% compared to the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). 90 node cultures were carried out on dogs with positive or negative LAT and/or positive or negative IFAT: The frequency of positive node cultures (70%) as versus positive LAT came between the results obtained for an IFAT >1/40 (64%) and IFAT >1/80 (73%). 32/33 (97%) dogs had positive node culture, LAT and IFIAT(>1/80). 6 dogs had negative LAT but positive node culture. 5 of these had also an IFAT < 1/160. This test was used in the field on several eco-epidemiological surveys in leishmanian enzootic areas. Node cultures were made on the dogs with positive TL. 39 strains were isolated: 18 in Algeria, 15 in Morocco, 2 in Syria and 4 in Yemen. 13/39 strains were obtained from dogs with IFI <1/160. 2 at 1/20 8 at 1/40 and 3 at 1/80. In Algeria this test was also used for the diagnosis of human visceral leishmaniasis in a child. This quick, simple, sensitive and specific test could be usefully carried out on ""field"" surveys for the diagnosis of visceral-leishmaniasis in animals and human beings."
"Antibody-ELISA for Trypanosoma evansi: Application in a serological survey of dairy cattle, Thailand, and validation of a locally produced antigen","Trypanosoma evansi is generally considered a mild pathogen in bovines. However, in Asia, acute and chronic signs have been observed in cattle, with high levels of parasitaemia, abortion and death. investigations in Asian cattle are needed to better understand this epidemiological situation. To generate comparable data at a regional level, development and standardization of an antibody-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for T. evansi (ELISA/T evansi) was initiated and applied in an epidemiological survey carried out in dairy cattle in Thailand. A batch of 1979 samples was collected from dairy farms located throughout the country's four regions. Soluble T. evansi antigens initially produced in France were also produced in Thailand for comparison and technology transfer. Screening of 500 samples allowed us to identify reference samples and to determine the cut-off value of the ELISA. Seropositive animals - some of them confirmed by PCR - were found in the four regions, in 12 out of 13 provinces, in 22 out of 31 districts, in 56 farms out of 222 (25%, 95%CI +/- 6%) and in 163 animals out of 1979 (8.2. 95%CI +/- 1.2%). Estimated seroprevalence in 35 farms ranged between 1% and 30%, and in 21 farms it was >30%. Approximately 25% of survey cattle were exposed to the infection, in various situations. A sub-sample of 160 sera was tested on both antigens. Wilcoxon's (Z = 1.24; p = 0.22) and McNemars's tests (CH12 = 3.55; p = 0.09) did not show any significant differences, showing that the locally produced antigen is suitable for further evaluation in the surrounding countries. Use of this standardized serological method will broaden knowledge of the prevalence and impact of the disease at the regional level in South-East Asia. Further validation of this ELISA will be necessary in other host species such as buffalo, horse and pig. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Interspecific variability of prevalence in blood parasites of adult passerine birds during the breeding season in Alaska,"Blood parasite prevalence based on microscopic examination of stained blood smears was determined in adults of 11 passerine bird species sampled during their breeding season (May and June 1997-98) in interior Alaska (USA). These species included primarily Nearctic migratory species such as the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and neotropical migratory species such as the blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata), alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus), northern waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis), and bank swallow (Riparia riparia) as well as one long-distance palearctic migrant, the arctic warbler (Phylloscopus borealis). The more prevalent parasites were Leucocytozoon dubreuili (73% of the sampled turdinids), L. fringillinarum (42% of the sampled fringillids and parulids), and Trypanosoma avium (39% of the sampled hosts). Other parasites (H. fallisi: 18% of the sampled turdinids; Haemoproteus paruli: 14% of the sampled parulids; H, fringillae: 5% of the sampled fringillids; microfilariae: 14% of the sampled hosts) were observed less frequently. Plasmodium vaughani was found only in two yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia). Overall parasite prevalence varied between 0% in the alder flycatcher to >80% in Swainson's thrush, arctic warbler, and Townsend's warbler (Dendroica townsendi). Prevalence of various hematozoa also was bird species-dependent. No relationship was observed between prevalence and either foraging (aerial versus trees/shrubs) or nesting habits (ground versus arboreal) or general location of the wintering area of the different species examined. Prevalence also was unrelated to average dates of arrival on breeding grounds and, therefore, to potential duration of exposure to local insect vectors before capture. Differences in blood parasite prevalence among species breeding in a same region and in the same type of habitat may result from differences in host specificity such as immunological resistance to infection or blood meal preference by potential vectors and/or in behavioral adjustments/physiological traits that alter exposure to vectors."
Epidemiological survey of vector-borne infections in equids from northern Tunisia,"Leishmaniosis (Leishmania infantum infection) and piroplasmoses (Theileria equi and Babesia caballi infections) are vector-borne diseases with significant economic and public health impacts. Despite their importance, there is a lack of data concerning these infections in equids from Tunisia. The present study was carried out to estimate the prevalence of L. infantum, T. equi and B. caballi in 104 equids from northern Tunisia. The authors reported for the first time on the seroprevalence of anti-Leishmania antibodies in equids in Tunisia (6.7%). The study reported a high infection prevalence of piroplasms (23.1%), revealed for the first time T. equi and B. caballi infections in Tunisian donkeys, and showed that these animals act as reservoirs for the maintenance and dissemination of piroplasms."

Specific anti-Leishmania spp. antibodies in stray cats in Greece,"Greece is a highly endemic country for Leishmania species. Canine cases of leishmaniosis are recorded in different parts of the country. However, no case of feline leishmaniosis has been reported yet. In the present study, the seroprevalence in cats was investigated as a first approach to measuring Leishmania spp. infection of this animal species, in Greece. For this purpose, blood serum samples from 284 stray adult cats, living in the major area of Thessaloniki (Northern Greece), were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of anti-Leishmania spp. IgG. Eleven (3.87%) of the examined animals were found positive. The prevalence was lower in cats than in dogs coming from the same area, based on previous studies. Despite the low seroprevalence for Leishmania spp. in cats, leishmaniosis may be taken into consideration concerning the differential diagnosis of the feline diseases, especially in endemic areas.

EVALUATION OF A DIRECT SEROLOGICAL CARD AGGLUTINATION-TEST IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF CAMEL TRYPANOSOMOSIS DUE TO TRYPANOSOMA-EVANSI,"The results of a novel direct serological card agglutination test for the diagnosis of camel trypanosomosis due to Trypanosoma evansi (CATT/T. evansi) were compared with those obtained by direct detection of parasites in a study using 1,093 sera from camels raised in northern Mali. A good correlation was revealed between the percentage of positive results obtained by CATT and the presence of trypanosomes (89%), as well as a good coincidence between the percentage of positive results obtained by CATT and low haematocrit values (packed cell volume). CATT revealed a global serological prevalence of 30.6%, whereas trypanosomes were found in only 5.85% of the corresponding animals. CATT/T. evansi is a quick and easy-to-read test, which merits further evaluation in camel-rearing countries."
"Ecological aspects of Rhodnius nasutus Stal, 1859 (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) in palms of the Chapada do Araripe in Ceara, Brazil","The aim of this work is to present aspects related to the ecology of Rhodnius nasutus Stal, 1859 in palms from Chapada do Araripe in Ceara, Brazil. The following five species of palms were investigated: babacu (Attalea speciosa), buriti (Mauritia flexuosa), carnauba (Copernicia prunifera), catole (Syagrus oleracea) and macauba-barriguda (Acrocomia intumescens). Fifth palms were dissected (10 specimens for each species). The overall infestation index was 86%, with a total of 521 triatomines collected. The Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, 1909 Index was 16.8% and two insects presented mixed infection with Trypanosoma rangeli Tejera, 1920. A precipitin test showed that R. nasutus from palms of Chapada do Araripe are associated with opossum and bird although other possible bloodmeals were observed. Our results showing a high index of infestation of the palms as well as T. cruzi infection, the association of R. nasutus with the most diverse species of palms and proximity of these palms to houses demonstrate the importance of this area for sylvatic T. cruzi transmission and suggest the need for epidemiological surveillance in the region of the Chapada do Araripe."
"Variables associated with the prevalence of anti-Leishmania spp. antibodies in dogs on the tri-border of Foz do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil","The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of anti-Leishmania spp. antibodies in dogs from localities in the city of Foz do Iguacu, Parana state, Brazil, on the border with Argentina and Paraguay. Blood samples dogs were collected to perform the following serologic tests: immunochromatographic DPP (R) rapid test, indirect immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). In 2012, 285 dogs were analyzed on Argentina border, and in 2013, serum samples from 396 dogs on the border of Paraguay were collected. Using ELISA for screening and IFA for the confirmatory test, the results showed that the antibody prevalence was 1.8% (5/285) on the border of Argentina and 3.0% (12/396) on Paraguay border. When using the DPP (R) for screening and ELISA as a confirmatory analysis, we observed a seroreagent prevalence in dogs of 2.5% (7/285) on Argentina border and 5.1% (20/396) on Paraguay border. The non-public collection of domestic waste (p = 0.0004) was shown to be associated with leishmaniasis. This study shows the presence of leishmaniasis and suggest the emergence of canine visceral leishmaniasis in state of Parana due to the confirmed occurrence of seroreactive dogs on Argentina and Paraguay border, which has environmental and geographical characteristics that favor the spread of the parasite."
High rates of Leishmania infantum and Trypanosoma nabiasi infection in wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in sympatric and syntrophic conditions in an endemic canine leishmaniasis area: Epidemiological consequences,"Leishmania infantum infection has been reported in various host species, both domestic and wild, in some cases with high prevalence rates. However, until the recent discovery of infected hares, no studies had provided clear evidence of any significant reservoir other than domestic dogs. Our focus was on another lagomorph, Oryctolagus cuniculus or wild rabbit. This species is native to the Iberian Peninsula and its presence and abundance gave rise to the name of Spain. In an endemic area for canine leishmaniasis in the southeast of Spain, 150 rabbits were captured over a period of three years. Samples of blood, bone marrow, liver, spleen, heart and skin were taken and analysed through parasitological, serological and molecular techniques in order to detect Leishmania and Trypanosoma. 20.7% of the rabbits were infected with L. infantum and 82.4% with Trypanosoma nabiasi, and 14.8% of mixed infections were detected. Both parasites were found in all the animal organs analysed, a factor which, along with the presence of serological cross-reactions, must be taken into account in epidemiological studies on leishmaniasis. O. cuniculus is an abundant and gregarious species, with a long enough average lifespan to ensure L infantum transmission. The presence of the parasite in the skin and blood of these rabbits with no acute manifestation of disease ensures its contact with the vector, which finds in their warrens a suitable biotope to inhabit. The rabbit therefore seems to meet the most of conditions for being considered a reservoir host of L. infantum. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Potential Animal Reservoirs of Toscana Virus and Coinfections with Leishmania infantum in Turkey,"Toscana virus (TOSV), a sandfly-borne phlebovirus, is an important agent of human meningoencephalitis in the Mediterranean region, for which vertebrates acting as reservoirs have not yet been determined. This study investigates TOSV and Leishmania infections in dogs, cats, sheep, and goats from Adana and Mersin provinces in southeastern Turkey. TOSV neutralizing antibodies were demonstrated in 40.4% of the dog and 4% of the goat samples. TOSV RNA was detected in 9.9% of the 252 samples that mainly comprise dogs (96%). Thus, canine species can be suggested as the candidate reservoirs of TOSV. Partial sequences revealed the activity of TOSV genotypes A and B. In two dogs presenting with symptoms of canine leishmaniasis, infections of TOSV genotype B and Leishmania infantum have been documented, describing the first report of coinfections with these agents."
Canine Infections and Partial S Segment Sequence Analysis of Toscana Virus in Turkey,"Introduction: Toscana virus (TOSV) is a sandfly-borne bunyavirus with a significant public health impact. Preliminary studies have revealed TOSV exposure in dogs and they were suggested as potential reservoirs. This study was performed to characterize canine TOSV infections in an endemic region. Sequencing of TOSV small (S) segment in several previously identified specimens was also undertaken to reveal viral genealogy. Materials and Methods: Canine and feline plasma were collected in several districts of Mersin province, Mediterranean Anatolia, Turkey, during May-September, 2015. Phlebovirus RNA was screened through two nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, targeting S and large (L) segments of the viral genome. A kinetoplast minicircle nested PCR was employed for Leishmania DNA detection and typing. Previously collected TOSV-positive specimens from humans, dogs, cats, and sandflies from various regions in Turkey and Cyprus were further evaluated through the S segment PCR. All amplicons were characterized through sequencing. Results: A total of 210 specimens that comprise canine (76.2%) and feline (23.8%) plasma were screened. In three (1.9%) and two (1.3%) canine specimens, TOSV and Leishmania nucleic acids were detected, respectively. The TOSV strains were characterized as genotype B, and Leishmania infantum was identified in positive specimens. Twenty-four partial S segment sequences were amplified, which demonstrated a maximum intramural diversity of 3.88% in the nucleotide level. Sequence comparisons revealed significant similarities to particular genotype B strains characterized in Spain and France, whereas a notable divergence was observed among several TOSV strains. Single or recurrent amino acid substitutions were noted in eight residues of the viral nucleocapsid. Discussion: Canine infections of TOSV genotype B, with temporal and spatial association with L. infantum, were detected. Divergent TOSV S segment sequences with amino acid substitutions, presumably associated with host adaptation, were observed."
Surveillance for zoonotic vector-borne infections using sick dogs from southeastern Brazil,"For many vector-borne organisms, dogs can be used as sentinels to estimate the risk of human infection. The objective of this study was to use dogs as sentinels for multiple vector-borne organisms in order to evaluate the potential for human infection with these agents in southeastern Brazil. Blood from 198 sick dogs with clinicopathological abnormalities consistent with tick-borne infections were selected at the Sao Paulo State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Botucatu and tested for DNA and/or antibodies against specific vector-borne pathogens. At least one organism was detected in 88% of the dogs, and Ehrlichia canis DNA was amplified from 78% of the blood samples. Bartonella spp. seroreactivity was found in 3.6%. Leishmania chagasi antibodies were detected in 1% of the dogs. There was no serological or polymerase chain reaction evidence of infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia ewingii, and Rickettsia rickettsii. The full E. canis 16S rRNA gene sequence of one of the Brazilian strains obtained in this study was identical to the causative agent of human ehrlichiosis in Venezuela. Ehrlichia canis may pose a human health hazard and may be undiagnosed in southeastern Brazil, whereas exposure to the other organisms examined in this study is presumably infrequent."
Sero-epidemological survey on canine visceral leishmaniasis and the distribution of sandfly vectors in northwestern Turkey: Prevention strategies for childhood visceral leishmaniasis,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum, is an endemic disease in Aegean and Mediterranean Regions among humans and dogs. In this study, a sero-epidemiological survey for VL and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), which both are sporadically reported in the region, were carried out in the villages of Eskisehir, Afyon, and Bilecik cities. The study was designed according to the location of the sporadic cases of VL and CL, and blood samples of 111 dogs were randomly collected. Lymph node aspiration samples were taken from dogs that have popliteal lymphadenopathy. Sand flies were also collected using CDC light traps in the several localities. The sera samples were screened using IFAT, ELISA, rk39 ELISA and dip-stick tests for anti-Leishmania antibodies. A total of 15 (13.51 per cent) dogs out of 111 were found to be seropositive by at least one of the tests. The seropositivity ratios among dogs were found to be 27.5 per cent (8/29), 9.09 per cent (4/44) and 7.8 per cent (3/38) in Afyon, Bilecik and Eskisehir cities respectively. Leishmania amastigotes were detected in 4 of the 14 lymph node aspiration samples (eight seronegative, six seropositive), and all of them were seropositive dogs. One year later, two of the dogs were found to be dead and the other two were severely ill. Among the 179 collected Phlebotomus specimens from, Phlebotomus major was found to be abundant (35.7 per cent) and the other species were P. simici (28.5 per cent), P. similis (34.7 per cent) and P. alexandri (1.1 per cent). In the study area, canine VL is more spread than human VL. Because dogs are playing an important role for VL in Mediterranean Basin, and development of appropriate control measures will be necessary for childhood VL."
"Visceral leishmaniasis in Cameroon. Serepiderniological survey in Kousseri area, northern Cameroon","A sero-epidemiological survey of school children was carried out in Kousseri, a focus for visceral leishmaniasis. Sero-immunological assays for the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies were based on the indirect immunofluorescence assay test and counter-immunoelectrophoresis. 9 out of 223 school children tested positive for visceral leishmaniasis (seroprevalence rate of 4%), These 9 cases had no history of the disease. The data obtained confirm the endemicity of visceral leishmaniasis in this focus and call for extensive studies in order to determine the prevalence of the disease in the entire population as well as the main components of the transmission cycle."
Low Prevalence of Chagas Parasite Infection in a Nonhuman Primate Colony in Louisiana,"Chagas disease, an important cause of heart disease in Latin America, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which typically is transmitted to humans by triatomine insects. Although autochthonous transmission of the Chagas parasite to humans is rare in the United States, triatomines are common, and more than 20 species of mammals are infected with the Chagas parasite in the southern United States. Chagas disease has also been detected in colonies of nonhuman primates (NHP) in Georgia and Texas, and heart abnormalities consistent with Chagas disease have occurred at our NHP center in Louisiana. To determine the level of T. cruzi infection, we serologically tested 2157 of the approximately 4200 NHP at the center; 34 of 2157 primates (1.6%) tested positive. Presence of the T. cruzi parasite was confirmed by hemoculture in 4 NHP and PCR of the cultured parasites. These results strongly suggest local transmission of T. cruzi, because most of the infected NHP were born and raised at this site. All 3 species of NHP tested yielded infected animals, with significantly higher infection prevalence in pig-tailed macaques, suggesting possible exploration of this species as a model organism. The local T. cruzi strain isolated during this study would enhance such investigations. The NHP at this center are bred for use in scientific research, and the effects of the Chagas parasite on infected primates could confuse the interpretation of other studies."

"Prevalence of canine infection from endemic areas of American cutaneous leishmaniasis in Paracambi District, Rio de Janeiro State, between 1992 and 1993","In the district of Paracambi, State of Rio de Janeiro an epidemiological survey for American tegumentary leisbmaniasis in canine population was carried out in endemic localities. A total of 179 dogs was registered and 138 (7.1 %) examined for their clinical aspects, development of delayed by persensitivity (DHS) with Imunoleish (R) antigen and serological responses by indirect immunofluorescent reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In 9 (6.5 %) dogs with active cutaneous lesions or suspect scars, 66.7 % were caused by Leishmania sp; 44.4 % produced infection in banisters and showed growth in culture media, which was considered to be compatible with the species of Leishmania brazihensis complex. The molecular characterization (isoenzyme and KONA restriction profiles) defined two strains with similar profiles for L. (Viannia) braziliensis. The prevalence of canine infection estimated by the cutaneous test, IFR and ELISA was 10.1 %, 16.7 % and 27.8 %, respectively. The presence of clinical/sub-clinical form of ATL in canine population associated with human infections suggested that the dog can act as source of infection as well as for dissemination of the disease."
"Prevalence of anti-Leishmania spp antibodies in dogs from Garanhuns, in the middle scrub zone (Agreste) of Pernambuco","Introduction: Considering the unknown situation regarding canine visceral leishmaniasis in Garanhuns, this study had the aim of investigating occurrences of anti-Leishmania spp antibodies in domesticated and partially domesticated dogs, and the possible risk factors involved. Methods: In the first phase of the study, 256 blood samples were collected from dogs and subjected to the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) reaction at a dilution of 1:40. Additionally, 23 IFAT-positive samples were tested using an immunochromatographic dipstick test. In the second phase, new blood samples were collected from 18 dogs that were IFAT-positive in the first phase. These animals were retested using IFAT (1: 40 and 1: 80) and, additionally, by means of the polymerase chain reaction to investigate the Leishmania infantum DNA. Furthermore, 16 of these samples were retested using the immunochromatographic dipstick test. Results: In the first phase of the study, 16% of the samples were IFAT-positive (1: 40) and only three (13%) were positive in the immunochromatographic dipstick test. In the second phase, 12 samples were IFAT-positive at the dilution of 1: 40, and seven were also positive at 1:80. None of the samples were positive in the polymerase chain reaction testing or in the immunochromatographic dipstick test. Clinical signs suggestive of visceral leishmaniasis were observed in 4.9% of the IFAT-positive dogs. There were no statistical differences in relation to age, sex or clinical status of the dogs, but there was a difference in relation to place of origin. Conclusions: The domesticated and partially domesticated dogs living in Garanhuns present anti-Leishmania spp antibodies, but are mostly asymptomatic."
"Survey of infectious and parasitic diseases in stray cats at the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, Portugal","A survey of infectious and parasitic diseases of stray cats was carried out using biological samples collected from animals captured during a catch-neuter-release programme in four counties of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. The main objective was to investigate the potential threat of stray cats for animal and public health. Samples of blood, stool, hair and auricular swabs were collected from 231 cats in 27 colonies. Anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were detected in 47/194 samples (24.2%); anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies in 1/180 cats (0.6%); intestinal parasites in 23/74 samples (Toxocara cati, Isospora felis, Ancylostoma tubaeforme, Dipylidium caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Toxascaris leonina) and Otodectes cynotis in 4/182 cats (2.2%); dermatophyte fungi were isolated in 40/136 samples (29.4%); feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies were detected in 23/226 samples (10.2%); feline leukaemia virus antigen in 14/198 samples (7.1%); and feline coronavirus RNA in 9/127 samples (7.1%). Our results revealed that zoonotic agents, namely dermatophyte fungi and Toxocara call were present in stray cat colonies in the investigated counties. Overall the low frequency of major pathogens suggests a balanced relationship between host and agents. (C) 2009 ISFM and AAFP. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
The quest for canine leishmaniasis in Romania: the presence of an autochthonous focus with subclinical infections in an area where disease occurred,"Background: Canine leishmaniasis is a severe, potentially life-threatening, systemic vector-borne disease of dogs caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. Romania has been traditionally regarded as a non-endemic country for leishmaniasis with sporadic human disease cases. However, the recent report of an autochthonous canine leishmaniasis case (the first in the last 80 years) suggested the presence of an infection focus in the area of Ramnicu Valcea. The present study describes a survey of canine leishmaniasis in this geographical area with comparison to a georeferenced dataset of sand fly distribution based on historical literature records. Methods: The study was carried out in Ramnicu Valcea and included samples (serum, blood and conjunctival swabs) collected from 80 dogs including client-owned dogs from two local practices and dogs from two public shelters. Serum anti-leishmanial antibodies were assessed by ELISA. All blood and conjunctival samples were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR, targeting the leishmanial kinetoplast minicircle DNA. Results: Three dogs (3.7 %) were seropositive and another four (5.0 %) showed borderline results indicative of exposure or infection. TaqMan PCR was performed for all dogs, on both blood and conjunctival swabs. Seven dogs (8.7 %) were positive by conjunctival swab PCR and one dog (1.2 %) by blood PCR. None of the positive dogs presented clinical signs compatible with canine leishmaniasis. Conclusions: This is the first study evaluating canine leishmaniasis in a dog population in Romania by both highly sensitive PCR and serology. Although the prevalence was relatively low compared to other endemic regions, our results clearly demonstrate the presence of a canine leishmaniasis focus in Romania."
"Canine visceral leishmaniasis, United States and Canada, 2000-2003","Visceral leishmaniasis, caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania donovani complex, is a vectorborne zoonotic infection that infects humans, dogs, and other mammals. In 2000, this infection was implicated as causing high rates of illness and death among foxhounds in a kennel,in New York. A serosurvey of > 12,000 foxhounds and other canids and 185 persons in 35 states and 4 Canadian provinces was performed to determine geographic extent, prevalence, host range, and modes of transmission within foxhounds, other dogs, and wild canids and to assess possible infections in humans. Foxhounds infected with Leishmania spp. were found in 18 states and 2 Canadian provinces. No evidence of infection was found in humans. The infection in North America appears to be widespread in foxhounds and limited to clog-to-dog mechanisms of transmission; however, if the organism becomes adapted for vector transmission by indigenous phlebotomines, the probability of human exposure will be greatly increased."
"Epidemiological study of common diseases and their risk factors in camels in South Punjab, Pakistan","Bacteriological study of mastitis along with common blood protozoan diseases were studied in dromedary camels in Cholistan, Dera Ismail Khan and Rahim Yar Khan districts in South Punjab, Pakistan. For this purpose 300 camels were sampled randomly at different common grazing and watering point. For study of blood parasites clinically suspected and apparently healthy camels, 150 each, were sampled. An overall prevalence of 15%and 5% was recorded for trypanosomiasis and Anaplasmosis respectively. Trypanosoma evansi was identified with 280 bp product on polymerase chain reaction test. There was significant (P < 0.05) decline in the values of total erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, serum total proteins and albumin while erythrocyte sedimentation rate was increased in infected camels as compared to healthy ones. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase were also significantly increased in blood protozoan the infected animals. Milk samples for bacteriology were collected from healthy lactating camels (n = 100). Information about different risk factors were gathered on designed performa. Subclinical mastitis on surf field test was recorded in 42% camels while 2% cases of clinical mastitis were recorded. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Bacillus cereus and. Corynebacterium kutscheri were isolated with characteristic beta and alpha hemolysis patterns. Chi-square analysis showed significant difference as p < 0.05 among various species of bacteria (x(2) = 21.649, P Value = 0.0001, df = 3). Antibiogram showed Gentamicin, Norfloxacin, Oxytetracycline as most effective therapy for mastitis in camel. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Prevalence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Humans and Dogs in Pakistan,"The study was undertaken from May 2007 to June 2008 to determine the prevalence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in humans and dogs in four regions of Pakistan. Humans and dogs were screened for the disease and potential positive cases were identified on the basis of skin lesions. Samples of blood and skin lesions were collected for thin smear and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination. PCR analyses of clinical samples were found to be positive for a single schizodeme of Leishmania tropica. It was also revealed that PCR could detect DNA from less than a single parasite and can be effectively used in epidemiological surveys. Both dry and muco-purulent cutaneous forms of the disease were found to be endemic in the North, South and West of Pakistan. The East and South-eastern regions were non endemic. No case of visceral form of disease was encountered during the period of study from any part of the country. In Northern Pakistan the disease was most prevalent in humans in November 2007 (661) and least prevalent during February 2008 (292) while in dogs the highest prevalence was during November 2007 (24%) and lowest prevalence in January 2008 (5%). In Southern Pakistan the highest human disease prevalence was in April 2008 (518 cases) and lowest disease detections in June 2007 with 308 cases. In dogs, the highest number of cases were in December 2007 (25% cases) and least number during July 2007 (9% cases). In Western Pakistan the human disease prevalence was highest in October 2007 (281 cases) and lowest during Feb.2008 (66 cases) while in dogs most cases were detected in Nov. 2007 (21% cases) and the number of cases was lowest in Feb. 2008 (8%)."
SEROLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS OF LEISHMANIASIS - ON DETECTING INFECTION AS WELL AS DISEASE,"Serological tests are very frequently used in epidemiological surveys of leishmaniasis and other parasitoses. Their sensitivity and specificity are generally defined with respect to parasitism and disease, rather than infection. The reason is that known positives are those individuals most likely to yield parasites, or who have distinctive clinical signs, and concomitantly high antibody titres. This paper investigates the performance of one serological method, the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), in detecting Leishmania infantum infection during an intensive 2-year cohort study of dogs in southern France. The results show that sensitivity and specificity with respect to infection can be simultaneously high, but maximum sensitivity is probably < 80 %, and lasts for a relatively short period of 2-3 months after a lengthy incubation period. The IFAT gave the incidence of infection as 18-65 % in the first year, whereas the best estimate of incidence based on parasite isolation and clinical observation was 72 %. But data from the second year suggest that the 72 % was itself an underestimate. We argue that, during epidemiological surveys, the IFAT in particular, and serological tests for leishmania in general, will underestimate prevalence, incidence and hence the scale of the control problem. However, there is evidence that tests for canine leishmaniasis employing high threshold titres will identify the most infectious animals, allowing selective treatment or culling of those which contribute disproportionately to transmission."
REGIONAL AND SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF AVIAN BLOOD PARASITES FROM NORTHERN SOUTH-AFRICA,"The prevalence of avian haematozoa in 2285 birds of 211 species representing 28 families was studied in samples obtained from five regions of the northern portion of the Republic of South Africa over a three-year period. Species of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon were the most commonly encountered blood parasites with species of Hepatozoon, Trypanosoma, Plasmodium and microfilariae, in that order of frequency, occurring in far fewer numbers. Blood parasites were most prevalent in the Lydenburg district, and fewest at Nossob Camp in the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park and Pafuri in the Kruger National Park. Peak prevalence was primarily associated with rainfall rather than season."
"THE PREVALENCE OF BLOOD PARASITES IN HELMETED GUINEAFOWLS, NUMIDA-MELEAGRIS, IN THE KRUGER-NATIONAL-PARK","Bloodsmears were taken from separate groups of five helmeted guineafowls, Numida meleagris, shot at approximately monthly intervals at Skukuza and near Lower Sabie in the Kruger National Park during the period August 1988 to August 1990. Ninety-eight (86 %) of 114 guineafowls had single or multiple infections of Aegyptianella sp., Haemoproteus pratasi, Hepatozoon sp., Leucocytozoon neavei, Plasmodium circumflexum and Trypanosoma numidae. The apparent seasonal prevalence of Aegyptianella sp., H. pratasi and L. neavei, the three most commonly occurring parasites (42 %, 49 % and 56 % of birds infected respectively), is probably dependent on the presence of their respective vectors."
Serological survey on some pathogens in wild brown hares (Lepus europaeus) in Central Italy,"Objective: To determine the exposure of wild brown hares [Lepus europaeus (L. europaeus), pallas] to Anaplasma phagocytophilum (A. phagocytophilum), Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) sensu lato, Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi), Leishmania sp., Neospora caninum (N. caninum) and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). Methods: Two hundred twenty-two blood serum samples of wild brown hares captured in protected areas of the province of Pisa (Central Italy) were tested to detect antibodies against the reported pathogens. Results: Thirty one (14.0%) animals resulted positive for at least one tested agent, with antibody titres ranging from 1:20 to 1:320. In particular, 13 (5.8%) samples were positive to B. burgdorferi s.l., 11 (4.9%) to N. c:aninum, 3 (1.3%) to 7. gondii, 2 (0.9%) to A. phagocylophiluni and 2 (0.9%) to Leis/mania sp. No samples scored positive to E. cuniculi. Four animals (14.8%) resulted coinfected with 2 different pathogens. Conclusion: The obtained results showed that B. burgdorferi s.l. N. caninum, T. gondii, A. phagocytophilum and Leishmania sp circulate in wild brown hares in Central Italy, suggesting a possible role of L. europaeus as reservoir of these pathogens. The obtained results showed that autochthonous wild brown hares living in Central Italy have been exposed to several pathogens circulating in this area, suggesting a possible role of L. europaeus as reservoir."
Trypanosomatid prevalence and host habitat choice in woodland Drosophila,"Although trypanosomatids (Trypanosomatidae: Kinetoplastida) are common inhabitants of dipteran guts, prevalence in natural fly populations has not been studied, We investigated factors associated with trypanosomatid prevalence in eight species of woodland Drosophila (Drosophilidae: Diptera) collected from five sites in southwest Ohio. We collected infected flies from every site, over both years of our study, and from every Drosophila species. Prevalence differed with host species, but not between sites or with host sex. Prevalence was highest in the most abundant species, members of the subgenus Sophophora, species using decaying fruit as breeding sites, and those able to use more than one type of substrate for oviposition.

Molecular detection of Leishmania infantum and Leishmania tropica in rodent species from endemic cutaneous leishmaniasis areas in Morocco,"Background: Leishmaniasis remains a major public health problem in African nations, including Morocco, where little is known about the vertebrate reservoirs involved in the causal parasites' transmission cycles. The present study investigates the role of rodent species as potential reservoirs of Leishmania spp. in central Morocco, where both L. tropica and L. infantum have been reported. Methods: Rodents were caught from 22 sites in central Morocco, by using Sherman metal traps, and identified morphologically. For each specimen, genomic DNA was extracted from different tissues using the Speed Tools DNA extraction Kit. Then, samples were PCR-analyzed, targeting the SSU rRNA gene to detect Leishmania spp. DNA, followed by amplification of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and its sequencing to identify the species. Results: A total of 197 rodents belonging to ten species were captured and identified: Rattus rattus (40.61%), Mus musculus (25.38%), Apodemus sylvaticus (8.63%), Mus spretus (7.11%), Meriones shawi (5.58%), Rattus norvegicus (4.57%), Meriones libycus (3.05%), Mastomys erythroleucus (2.03%), Gerbillus campestris (2.03%) and Lemniscomys barbarus (1.01%). Molecular analysis revealed the presence of Leishmania species in 18 specimens: six R. rattus (out of 80 captured; 7.5%), 11 M. musculus (out of 50 captured; 22%), and one R. norvegicus (out of 9 captured; 11.11%). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, L. infantum and L. tropica were identified in rodent species for the first time in Morocco. These findings suggest that rodent species may be involved in L. infantum and L. tropica transmission cycles in this country but that further studies are needed to confirm their role as reservoirs of Leishmania species in Morocco."
Clinical and therapeutic aspects of an outbreak of canine trypanosomiasis,"Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma evansi can seriously affect both domestic and wild animals. This article reports on an outbreak of canine trypanosomiasis on a farm in the Pantanal region of Brazil. The farm had 38 dogs, 20 of which died before receiving veterinary care. The remaining 18 dogs were underwent anamnesisn, clinical examination, hematological and biochemical evaluations. Blood smears and PCR analysis were performed for the diagnosis. The treatment protocols used according to the clinical recovery or parasitological cure of the dogs, using diminazene diaceturate, isometamidium chloride or quinapyramine sulfate. Post-treatment parasitological evaluation was performed by the microhematocrit technique. 7/18 dogs were PCR positive for T. evansi (confirmed by sequencing). There was clinical findings, which were consistent with both the acute and chronic stages of the disease in dogs. The infected dogs all exhibited at least one clinical sign of the disease. The hematological findings were compatible with trypanosomiasis, highlighting the hypochromic microcytic anemia as the main outcome. No treatment protocol was fully effective and the prolonged use of diminazene diaceturate caused the death of an animal. The trypanosomiasis can cause high rates of morbidity and mortality in dogs and difficulty in establishment an effective and safe therapeutic protocol."
"Bovine trypanosomosis in Gimbi district of Western Oromia, Ethiopia","A study on the epidemiology of bovine trypanosomosis was conducted from September 2006 to April 2007 in six villages of the Gimbi district in west Wollega zone of Ethiopia. The prevalence of the disease, the apparent densities and distribution of tsetse and other biting flies in two seasons, the dry and rainy, were determined. The results of a questionnaire survey from 80 farmers revealed that trypanosomosis was a major health problem affecting animals and impeding agricultural activities. A total of 568 blood samples were collected from randomly selected animals (280 animals in rainy and 288 in dry season) and revealed the presence of Trypanosoma congolense Broden, 1904 and T vivax Zieman, 1905 in the area. Trypanosoma congolense was the dominant species that accounted for 66.2% of the infections. The mean packed cell volume (PCV) concentrations were 22.77% (95% CI =19.99-21.55) in parasitaemic and 25.25% (95% CI=24.88-25.61) in aparasitaemic animals with a significant difference (P<0.005). There was a significant (P<0.012) difference in trypanosome infection between age groups of cattle, being higher in adults. The overall prevalence of trypanosomosis was 12.5%, while the disease prevalence was higher during the rainy season (15%) than the dry season (10.1%). In three villages of lowland areas (below 1600 meter above sea level), a higher prevalence was recorded 20.9% and 7.9% as compared to three villages of midland areas (>= 1600 meter above sea level) 11.8% and 8.3% in late rainy and dry season, respectively. A fly-survey was conducted by using 80 monoconical pyramidal traps and revealed that two tsetse species, namely Glossina morsitans submorsitans Newstead and Glossina tachinoides Westwood were found along with other biting flies (Tabanus, Haematopota and Stomoxys species). Higher numerical catches of Glossina were recorded in late rainy season and the apparent density was positively correlated (r=0.5171) with the prevalence of infection.

Prevalence and infection pattern of Trypanosoma evansi in camels in mid-Eastern Sudan,"The antigen detection enzyme immunoassay (AgELISA) in conjunction with parasitological examination of blood were used to study the enzootic situation of cameline trypanosomiasis in mid-Eastern Sudan. A one year survey showed that the infection is endemic among pastoral camels with a prevalence of 5.4% based on parasitological examination and 31.3% based on AgELISA. The infection rate was higher during the dry period (November to May) than the wet season. Young camels had a much lower infection rate as detected by parasitological techniques, but not with AgELISA. A lower prevalence of infection was detected by buffy coat technique (BCT) in herds of camels raised by nomads compared with those kept by agropastoralists and in camels located in the southern districts of mid-Eastern Sudan."
Molecular survey and characterization of Trypanosoma evansi in naturally infected camels with suspicion of a Trypanozoon infection in horses by molecular detection in Egypt,"In Egypt, although the Trypanosoma evansi has been reported frequently among domestic animals, there is no published data on T. evansi in horses. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and characterization of T. evensi in three governorates by examining blood samples from 40 local camels, 35 imported camels, 25 horses and 10 donkeys by PCR targeting the sequences of TBR and RoTat 1.2VSG. The overall prevalence of T. evansi was 54.5% and 21.8% by TBR PCR and RoTat 1.2VSG PCR, respectively. The TBR PCR detected T. evansi in 60% and 71.4%, respectively, of local and imported camels and in 10% and 40% of donkeys and horses, respectively. For RoTat 1.2VSG PCR, T. evansi was detected in 32.5% and 31.4 of local and imported camels, respectively. All horses and donkeys were negative by RoTat 1.2VSG PCR. TBR PCR was superior to RoTat 1.2VSG PCR in T. evansi infection detection. Statistically significant differences in the prevalence of the infection were observed on the basis of body condition and location. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, based on RoTat 1.2VSG, confirmed the presence of T. evansi, which was closely related to Egyptian and Indian isolates. In conclusion, TBR PCR is the best assay to monitor T. evansi infections in camels, horses, and donkeys. The presence of T. evansi in horses and donkeys possibly play a role in the transport of the infection to camels. This is the first report of T. evansi infection in horses in Egypt using TBR PCR."
Molecular Confirmation of Trypanosoma evansi and Babesia bigemina in Cattle from Lower Egypt,"Trypanosomosis and babesiosis are economically important vector-borne diseases for animal health and productivity in developing countries. In Egypt, molecular epidemiological surveys on such diseases are scarce. In the present study, we examined 475 healthy and 25 clinically diagnosed cattle from three provinces in Lower Egypt, for Trypanosoma (T.) and Babesia (B.) infections using an ITS1 PCR assay that confirmed Trypanosoma species presence and an 18S rRNA assay that detected B. bigemina. Results confirmed Trypanosoma spp. and B. bigemina presence in 30.4% and 11% individuals, respectively, with eight animals (1.6%) being co-infected with both hemoparasites. Subsequent type-specific PCRs revealed that all Trypanosoma PCR positive samples corresponded to T. evansi and that none of the animals harboured T. brucei gambiense or T. brucei rhodesiense. Nucleotide sequencing of the variable surface glycoprotein revealed the T. evansi cattle strain to be most closely related (99% nucleotide sequence identity) to strains previously detected in dromedary camels in Egypt, while the 18S rRNA gene phylogeny confirmed the presence of a unique B. bigemina haplotype closely related to strains from Turkey and Brazil. Statistically significant differences in PCR prevalence were noted with respect to gender, clinical status and locality. These results confirm the presence of high numbers of carrier animals and signal the need for expanded surveillance and control efforts. (C) 2016 PVJ. All rights reserved"
"High prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in shelter dogs from southern Louisiana, USA",
Active infection and morphometric study of Trypanosoma evansi among horses in Peninsula Malaysia,"Apart from occasional reports of clinical disease affecting horses, there is no information about Trypanosoma evansi in horses in Peninsula Malaysia. Thus, a cross-sectional study was conducted in eight states in Peninsula Malaysia to determine the active presence of T. evansi in horses. A total of 527 blood samples were obtained and examined by haematocrit centrifugation technique (HCT), Giemsa-stained thin blood smear (GSS), morphometric measurements, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloning of PCR products. The results showed an overall parasitological prevalence of 0.57% (3/527, CI: 1.6-0.19%) with both HCT and GSS. Morphometric study revealed the mean total length of the trypanosomes including the free flagellum was 27.94 +/- 2.63 mu m. PCR successfully amplified a trypanosome specific 257 bp in 1.14% of samples (6/527, CI: 2.4-0.52%) and was confirmed by nucleotide sequences. The mean packed cell volume (PCV) for the positive cases detected by HCT was lower (23% +/- 7.00) compared to the positive cases detected by PCR alone in the state of Terengganu (35% +/- 4.73). In conclusion, this study showed T. evansi infection occurred in low frequency in horses in Peninsula Malaysia, and anaemia coincided with parasitaemic animals. PCR is considered as a sensitive diagnostic tool when parasitaemia is undetectable. The slight lengthier mean of parasite and anaemia may indicate a virulent strain of T. evansi circulating throughout the country. Thus, it's highly recommended to shed light on host-parasite relationship for better epidemiological understanding."
"Surveillance and management of trypanosomiasis in cattle herds in Kauru area, Kaduna State, Nigeria",
Detection of T.b. rhodesiense trypanosomes in humans and domestic animals in south east Uganda by amplification of serum resistance-associated gene,"The human serum resistance-associated (SRA) gene was identified in 28 (80%) of the 35 T.b. rhodesiense trypanosomes from parasitologically confirmed sleeping sickness cases, using the primers designed by Radwanska and in 27 (77.1%) of the same 35 T.b. rhodesiense trypanosomes using the primers designed by Gibson. However, about 20% of the 35 T.b. rhodesiense trypanosomes could not be detected by SRA-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) even when an aliquot of the first PCR was used in the second PCR, indicating that the gene may be absent in those trypanosomes or the trypanosomes could be having another variant of SRA not detectable by these primers since three variants of SRA genes have so far been identified or the amount of trypanosomal DNA extracted from infected blood was too low to be detected. The trypanosome isolates that are SRA gene negative may indicate the presence of some T.b. rhodesiense trypanosomes with modified or lack SRA genes or simple loss of the SRA gene from the expression site in which it resides during antigenic variation. Analysis of trypanosomes derived from domestic animals showed that 79 (90.8%) of the 87 trypanosomes isolated from cattle were positive by Trypanosoma brucei (TBR)-PCR, indicating that they were Trypanozoom while 8 (9.2%) of the trypanosome isolates which were negative by TBR-PCR could be T vivax, T congolense, or T theileri. When subjected to SRA-PCR, 10 (11.5%) of the 87 trypanosomes isolates derived from cattle were positive, indicating that there could be T.b. rhodesiense circulating in cattle, which is similar to the percentage of T.b. rhodesiense previously obtained in cattle in Serere, Soroti district."

"Human Trypanosoma cruzi infection and seropositivity in dogs, Mexico","We used 5 diagnostic tests in a cross-sectional investigation of the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi in Tejupilco municipality, State of Mexico, Mexico. Our findings showed a substantial prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to T. cruzi in human (n = 293, IgG 2.05%, IgM 5.5%, both 7.1%) and dog (n = 114, IgG 15.8%, IgM 11.4%, both 21 %) populations. We also found antibodies to T cruzi (n = 80, IgG 10%, IgM 15%, both 17.5%) in dogs from Toluca, an area previously considered free of T cruzi. Our data demonstrate the need for active epiderniologic surveillance programs in these regions. A direct correlation (r(2) = 0.955) of seropositivity between humans and dogs suggests that seroanalysis in dogs may help identify the human prevalence of T. cruzi infection in these areas."
THE PREVALENCE OF CONCURRENT TRYPANOSOME AND GASTROINTESTINAL NEMATODE INFECTIONS IN WEST-AFRICAN DWARF SHEEP AND GOATS IN NSUKKA AREA OF EASTERN NIGERIA,"The prevalence of concurrent nematode-trypanosome infections in traditionally reared West African Dwarf sheep and goats in eastern Nigeria was monitored over a 12-month period during 1987-1988. The most prevalent nematodes were Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis, which usually occurred together in all nematode infected animals. Their combined prevalence rates ranged from 90 to 100% throughout the year and they accounted for 66 to 98% of the total monthly worm burdens. Of the 107 animals examined 13.6% were infected with trypanosome species comprising Trypanosoma brucei (50%), Trypanosoma conglense (43%) and Trypanosoma vivax (36%). No clear seasonal pattern was observed in the prevalence of concurrent nematode-trypanosome infection but owing to the widespread prevalence of gastrointestinal nematode infections, all trypanosome infected animals were invariably infected with H. contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis."
"Tsetse challenge, trypanosome and helminth infection in relation to productivity of village Ndama cattle in Senegal","Data on tsetse fly, and on village Ndama cattle collected over a 4-year period in southern Senegal, were analysed. A total of 431 Ndama cattle in four herds of three villages in the Upper Casamance area of southern Senegal were monitored monthly. Glossina morsitans submorsitans and Glossina palpalis gambiensis are present in the study area. Mean tsetse apparent density was 5.4 flies/trap/day. Trypanosome (Trypanosoma congonlense and Trypanosoma vivax) infection rate in flies was 2.4 (s.e. 0.37)%. Tsetse challenge index was 17.3 (s.e. 4.18). Mean monthly trypanosome prevalence in cattle was 2.5 (s.e. 0.51)%. Highest trypanosome prevalence occurred during the dry season, and animals less than 1-year old were more frequently infected than older animals. The linear relationship between the log10+1 tsetse challenge and the arcsine of the trypanosome prevalence was significant only when mean monthly values of these variables over the 4-year period were used with tsetse challenge preceding infection rate by 3 months. Mean monthly prevalence of strongyle, Strongyloides spp., Toxocara spp. and coccidia were 34.4 (s.e. 0.60), 2.1 (s.e. 0.18), 1.2 (s.e. 0.45) and 15.6 (s.e. 0.47)%, respectively. Calf mortality rate at 1, 6 and 12 months of age was 2.1 (s.e. 2.1), 5.2 (s.e. 2.8) and 12.2 (s.e. 3.3)%, respectively. Calving interval (584 s.e. 58 days) was not influenced by trypanosome status of the cow during lactation. Calving interval was shorter by 167 days when the calf died. before: I year of age in comparison to calving intervals for which the calf survived beyond one year. Live weight at birth, 6 and 12 months of age were 15.8 (s.e. 0.54), 48.1 (s.e. 2.56) and 71.1 (s.e. 5.44) kg, respectively. Mean lactation length, total and daily milk offtake were 389 (s.e. 16) days, 231 (s.e. 15) litres and 0.69 (s.e. 0.037) litres, respectively. Trypanosome infection during lactation did not have a significant effect on the amount of milk extracted for human consumption nor did trypanosome status affect calf growth.

Epidemiological aspects of canine visceral leishmaniosis in Azarshahr a new endemic focus of kala-azar in the Islamic Republic of Iran,"An epidemiological study to examine the sero-prevalence of zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis (ZVL) among domestic and wild canines in endemic foci of Azarshahr county of Iran was carried out during 2004-2005 to assess the distribution of the disease and the possible association between infection in dogs, wild canines and people. Anti -leishmanial antibodies were detected by the direct agglutination test (DAT). Parasitological study was performed for all captured wild canines and were detected in some of the seropositive dogs with specific clinical signs (n = 120). Serum samples (n = 1568) were collected from domestic dogs in villages that are known endemic foci of human visceral leishmaniosis (HVL). Wild canine sera were collected from jackals (Canis aureus, n = 10), foxes (Vulpes vulpes, n = 10) and wolves (Canis lupits, n = 10). Of the 120 serum sampled collected from domestic dogs, 23(19.7%)were positive by DAT (1:320 and above) and IFAT (1:160 and above).40(33.3%) of the dogs had lower titers than positive titer. No statistically significant difference was found between male and female sero-prevalence (P = 0.083). Dogs of 8 years and above showed the highest sero-prevalence (40.6%). Only 23.9% of the seropositive domestic dogs had clinical signs. Parasitology and serology tests that were performed in 30 wild canines showed 10% these animals were infected by Leishmania infantum. Fifteen of Leishmania spp. isolated from the dogs and wild canines were identified as Leishmania infanturn by molecular techniques."
"Screening infection of leishmania infantum in rodents trapped in Azarshahr County, Northwest of Iran","To examine the seroprevalence of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) among rodents in Azarshahr County, and to assess the possible association of infection among rodents in respect with transmission/prevalence of the disease among children, a survey was conducted during 2003-2004. Azarshahr County is an endemic region for leishmaniasis and this research is the first study in determining the host reservoirs in this county. In this survey, 265 rodents belonging to 7 genera/species were trapped alive. Anti-Leishmanial antibodies were detected through direct agglutination test (DAT), indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and microscopic examination. Fourteen (5.3%) animals were shown to be seropositive, 27 (10.2%) provided relatively lower titers, and 224 (84.5%) turned out to be seronegative. Amastigotes of Leishmania were observed in 4 seropositive rodents including 1 Meriones persicus, 2 Cricetalus migratorius and 1 Mesocicetus auratus after dissection and parasitological examinations. Multiple analyses of PCR were used to reassure the identity of purified isolates and infected clinical samples. According to the results of this study, the isolates were identified as Leishmania infantum and those infected rodents are assumed to be potential host reserviors for visceral leishmaniasis in the region. This work is the first report of detecting L. infantum infection in Cricetalus migratorius, Meriones persicus and Mesocricetus auratus from Iran."
Serological survey and comparison of two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis in dogs,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is systemic zoonotic parasitic infection that is a health problem in some tropical and subtropical countries. The purpose of our study is to determine the seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in owned dogs of the Sarab area and to identify the species of Leishmania isolated from these dogs. We also compared the sensitivities and specificities of two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (kDNA and ITS1) used for Leishmania infantum identification with culture, microscopic detection and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods as well as validate the PCR techniques for the molecular diagnosis of CVL. Sera from 384 dogs of 30 villages around Sarab, were tested by ELISA and buffy coat blood fractions after sampling tested with PCR by specific primers (kDNA, ITS-18sRNA). Thirty-five dogs were seropositive by ELISA. The seroprevalence rate (SPR) of CVL was 9.1% (CI, 95% 6.6 -12.4). The most important serological result was a high proportion of seropositivity for leishmaniasis. Out of 361 (94%) asymptomatic dogs, 31 (8.6%) were seropositive, and out of 23 (6%) symptomatic dogs, 4 (17.4%) were seropositive. Agreement between the ELISA test and clinical signs was 86.7%. Each assay was performed on 60 blood samples. PCR of kDNA (7/60 positives, 11.8%) was the most sensitive of the assays examined, followed by ELISA (3/60, 5%) and ITS1-PCR (2/60, 3.4 %). All diagnostic assays were highly specific (100 %) and had positive predictive values (PPV) >90% and negative predictive values (NPV) >88% for CVL. As expected, kDNA-PCR proved to be the most sensitive (87.5 %) assay for leishmanial DNA in peripheral blood. This study shows that kDNA-PCR is significantly more sensitive than the other parasitological and serological methods, allowing the identification of infected dogs even before the appearance of serum L. infantum antibodies. Because kDNA-PCR is the most reliable, sensitive, and also a rapid diagnostic assay for CVL, it should be employed as the new standard for routine diagnosis."

Canine visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum in Senegal: risk of emergence in humans?,"In the context of global warming and the risk of spreading arthropod-borne diseases, the emergence and reemergence of leishmaniasis should not be neglected. In Senegal, over the past few years, cases of canine leishmaniasis have been observed. We aim to improve the understanding of the transmission cycle of this zoonosis, to determine the responsible species and to evaluate the risk for human health. An epidemiological and serological study on canine and human populations in the community of Mont Rolland (Thies area) was conducted. The data showed a high seroprevalence of canine leishmaniasis (>40%) and more than 30% seropositive people. The dogs' seroprevalence was confirmed by PCR data (concordance > 0.85, Kappa > 0.7). The statistical analysis showed strong statistical associations between the health status of dogs and seropositivity, the number of positive PCRs, clinical signs and the number of Leishmania isolates. For the first time, the discriminative PCRs performed on canine Leishmania strains clearly evidenced that the pathogenic agent is Leishmania infantum. The results obtained show that transmission of this species is well established in this area. That the high incidence of seropositivity in humans may be a consequence of infection with this species is discussed. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of the Institut Pasteur."
Prevalence and incidence of trypanosomosis in horses and donkeys in the Gambia,"In a study of the prevalence and incidence of trypanosomosis in horses and donkeys in two regions of the Gambia, surveys were carried out at Niamina east and Bansang south with a high and low to moderate tsetse challenge, respectively. Eleven horses and 67 donkeys were sampled monthly from August 1997 to September 1998. Blood samples were examined for trypanosomes using the buffy-coat (BC) method and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three primer sets were used, specific for either Trypanosoma vivax (TVW), Trypanosoma congolense (GOL) or Trypanosoma brucei (ORPHON5J). The BC results showed that the prevalence (August 1997) and the average monthly incidence (September 1997-1998) of trypanosome infections in horses (45.5 and 16%, respectively) were significantly higher than in donkeys (6.2 and 9%, respectively). Using PCR, the number of detected cases was seven times higher than using the BC. T congolense was the most frequently observed species, followed by T vivax and T brucei. This study confirms earlier observations by other authors that donkeys, which are exposed to a similar tsetse challenge as horses, are significantly less infected with trypanosomes than the latter.

"Leishmania infection in humans, dogs and sandflies in a visceral leishmaniasis endemic area in Maranhao, Brazil","Leishmania infection in humans, dogs and sandflies was examined in the endemic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) municipality of Raposa, state of Maranhao, Brazil. In this study, we examined Leishmania chagasi infection in the blood serum of both humans and Canis familiaris and the natural Leishmania sp. infection rate in the sandfly vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indirect immunofluorescence reaction and polymerase chain reaction were performed to detect Leishmania infections in humans, dogs and sandflies, respectively. Overall, 186 out of 986 studied human beings were infected with L. chagasi parasites, representing an infection prevalence of 18.9%. An even higher infection rate was detected in dogs, where 66 (47.8%) out of 138 were infected. Among all Lu. longipalpis captured (n = 1,881), only 26.7% were females. The Leishmania infection frequency for the vector Lu. longipalpis was 1.56%. Remarkably, all infected sandflies were found in the peridomiciliary area. Furthermore, a high incidence of asymptomatic forms of VL in the human and canine populations was observed. The results of this study suggest autochthonous transmission of L. chagasi in this endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis because infection by Leishmania sp. was identified in all important elements of the transmission chain."
"Seroprevalence of Babesia bovis, B-bigemina, Trypanosoma evansi, and Anaplasma marginale antibodies in cattle in southern Egypt","Babesia bovis, B. bigemina, Trypanosoma evansi, and Anaplasma marginate infections cause serious diseases in cattle, and are primarily transmitted by arthropod vectors (ticks for B. bovis, B. bigemina, and A. marginate and various types of flies for T. evansi). In the last few years, there have been many reports of a high prevalence of certain protozoan infections in northern Egypt, but no accurate or adequate data are available for the southern regions. Therefore, in this study, we screened for evidence of such diseases in economically important cattle species using serum samples. The seroprevalence of protozoan infections in cattle was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using species-specific diagnostic antigens. In a total of 301 cattle serum samples, 27 (9.0%),100 (33.2%), and 127 (42.2%) were positive for specific antibodies against B. bovis, B. bigemina, and T. evansi, respectively. Sera from 90 cattle were also tested for antibodies against A. marginate, and 25 (28%) of them were positive. The highest coinfection rate occurred for B. bigemina and T. evansi with 10.6% (32/301). When age, sex, locality, and breeding system were investigated as predisposing factors, bulls and cattle <3 years old were more vulnerable to B. bovis infections than older animals, and geographic location affected the B. bigemina infection rate. The recorded seroprevalence of hemoprotozoan parasites and A. marginate in cattle suggests that these diseases have the potential capacity to detrimentally affect meat and milk production in southern Egypt.

"Occurrence and risk factors of zoonoses in dogs and owners in Sertao, Paraiba State, Northeastern Brazil","Seropositivity and risk factors for visceral leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis, and leptospirosis were investigated in 200 dogs and twenty-three owners in a municipality with a history of human cases of visceral leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis in the region of Sertao, Paraiba State, Northeastern Brazil. In dogs, frequencies of 6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7-9.3%), 7.5% (95% CI = 3.8-11.2%), 18% (95% CI = 12.7-23.3%), and 14% (95% CI = 9.2-18.8%) were found for visceral leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis, and leptospirosis, respectively. An age of over 72 months and environment conditions (soil) were identified as risk factors for Leishmania chagasi infection. Free housing was identified as risk factor for Trypanosoma cruzi infection. For toxoplasmosis, free housing and contact with cats were found to be risk factors, while commercial food was a risk factor for leptospirosis. Of the twenty-three owners who agreed to participate in the study, eight were tested for leishmaniasis, three for Chagas disease, nine for toxoplasmosis, eleven for leptospirosis, and five were tested for more than one disease. Only anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were found in the human population at a frequency of 44.4% (4/9); for all other diseases, all individuals were negative. The results indicate that such zoonoses are present in dogs from the studied region, but only toxoplasmosis was found in the owners. Our risk analysis suggests that cleaner soil, better storage of dog food, and avoiding free housing can reduce the risk of infection by these diseases."
Little evidence of seasonal variation of natural infection by Leishmania infantum in dogs in Spain,"Leishmania infantum, the etiological agent of canine leishmaniosis in the Mediterranean region, is vectored by Phlebotomus spp sandflies, which are active during the warmer months of the year. In order to determine whether seasonality in transmission induces seasonal changes in the prevalence of infection by L. infantum and of parasite-specific immune response, two groups of dogs, one in February (n = 37) and another in October (n = 42), were studied. Clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis, as well as presence of microscopic skin lesions in the muzzle were recorded for all dogs. Assays were also performed for detection of L. infantum parasites in muzzle skin samples (PCR, immunohistochemistry and culture), specific serum antibodies (ELISA), and specific lymphocyte proliferation and interferon-gamma production. Although prevalence of non-specific clinical signs increased significantly after the sandfly season, this was not the case for Leishmania-specific markers: positivity by PCR (24% vs. 21%) or inummohistochemistry (3% vs. 2%) of muzzle skin samples, as well as lymphocyte proliferation (59% vs. 50%) or interferon-gamma production (21% vs. 27%) were similar in February and in October. Only prevalence of positive specific antibody titers increased noticeably in October (8% vs. 20%), although this was not statistically significant. Overall, the sandfly season did not have a marked impact on the prevalence L. infantum infection or parasite-specific immune responses analyzed in this study.

Mixed infection of Leishmania infantum and Leishmania braziliensis in rodents from endemic urban area of the New World,"Background: In Brazil Leishmania braziliensis and L. infantum are the principal species responsible for cutaneous and visceral leishmaniases, respectively. Domestic dogs are the main reservoirs of visceral leishmaniasis, while rodents and marsupials are the main reservoirs for cutaneous leishmaniasis. It has also been suggested that dogs could play a role in transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The identification of the species of Leishmania, the reservoirs, and the vectors involved in each particular transmission cycle is critical for the establishment of control activities. Belo Horizonte has emerged as an endemic region for leishmaniases, however, epidemiological studies assessing the contribution of wild reservoirs to transmission are scarce in the area. The aim of this study was to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in possible reservoirs of an urbanized area. Results: A high rate of infection was found in small mammals (64.9%) and dogs (DG1 30.4% and DG2 48.6%). The presence of L. infantum and L. braziliensis was detected in small mammals and dogs, and mixed infections by both species were detected in rodents which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first description of this phenomenon in an urban area. Additionally, L. amazonensis was detected in the canine samples. Conclusion: The possible role of these animals as a source of infection of the vector of each species of Leishmania identified should not be overlooked and should be taken into account in future control activities. The results of mixed infection by L. braziliensis and L. infantum in cosmopolitan rodents as M. musculus and R. rattus, may have important implications in the context of the control of leishmaniasis in urban areas, especially when considering that these rodents live in close relationship with human dwellings, especially those in more precarious conditions."
"Leishmania (V.) braziliensis infecting bats from Pantanal wetland, Brazil: First records for Platyrrhinus lineatus and Artibeus planirostris","In the New World genus Leishmania parasites are etiological agents of neglected zoonoses known as leishmaniasis. Its epidemiology is very complex due to the participation of several species of sand fly vectors and mammalian hosts, and man is an accidental host. Control is very difficult because of the different epidemiological patterns of transmission observed. Studies about Leishmania spp. infection in bats are so scarce, which represents a large gap in knowledge about the role of these animals in the transmission cycle of these pathogens, especially when considering that Chiroptera is one of the most abundant and diverse orders among mammals. Leishmaniasis in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil are remarkably frequent, probably due to the abundance of its regional mastofauna. The recent record of L. braziliensis in bats from this state indicates the need to clarify the role of these mammals in the transmission cycle. In this study we evaluated the presence of Leishmania parasites in the skin of different species of bats, using PCR directed to Leishmania spp. kDNA for screening followed by PCR/RFLP analysis of the hsp70 gene for the identification of parasite species. Leishmania species identification was confirmed by PCR directed to the G6PD gene of L. braziliensis, followed by sequencing of the PCR product. Samples from 47 bats were processed, of which in three specimens (6.38%) was detected the presence of Leishmania sp. kDNA. PCR/RFLP and sequencing identified the species involved in the infection as L. braziliensis in all of them. This is the first report of Leishmania braziliensis in bats from Pantanal ecosystem and the first record of this species in Platyrrhinus lineatus and Artibeus planirostris, bats with a wide distribution in South America. These results reinforce the need to deepen the knowledge about the possibility of bats act as reservoirs of Leishmania spp. especially considering their ability of dispersion and occupation of anthropic environments."
"Detection and genotyping of Trypanosoma cruzi from acai products commercialized in Rio de Janeiro and Para, Brazil","Background: Several cases of food-borne acute Chagas disease (ACD) have been reported in the Brazilian Amazon so far. Up to 2004, the occurrence of ACD by oral transmission, associated with food consumption, was rare. Recent cases of ACD in Brazil have been attributed to the consumption of juice from the acai palm containing reservoir animals or insect vectors waste, infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. This study aimed to determine the T. cruzi contamination rate and to genotype the parasite in food samples prepared from acai, which are commercialized in Rio de Janeiro and the Para States in Brazil. Methods: The amplificability of DNA extracted from acai samples, and T. cruzi and Triatominae detection were performed by conventional PCR. Molecular characterization was done by multilocus PCR analysis, to determine the parasite discrete type units (DTUs) based on the size of PCR products in agarose gels, using the intergenic region of the spliced leader (SL), 24 Sa rDNA and nuclear fragment A10 as targets. Results: From the 140 samples of acai-based products analyzed, T. cruzi DNA was detected in 14 samples (10%); triatomine DNA was detected in one of these 14 samples. The parasite genotyping demonstrated that food samples containing acai showed a mixture of T. cruzi DTUs with TcIII, TcV and TcI prevailing. Conclusions: In this study, the molecular detection and identification of T. cruzi from acai-based manufactured food samples, was performed for the first time. Although parasite DNA is a marker of possible contamination during food manufacturing, our findings do not indicate that acai is a source of Chagas disease via oral transmission per se, as live parasites were not investigated. Nevertheless, a molecular approach could be a powerful tool in the epidemiological investigation of outbreaks, supporting previous evidence that acai-based food can be contaminated with T. cruzi. Furthermore, both food quality control and assessment of good manufacturing practices involving acai-based products can be improved, assuring the safety of acai products."
Epidemiological evaluation of Leishmania infantum zoonotic transmission risk in the recently established endemic area of Northwestern Italy,"Leishmania infantum infection had been expanding into new areas due to changes in vector and host biology. Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis has become endemic in previously unsuitable areas as vectors find favourable climatic conditions and an increasing number of reservoir dogs are moved between traditionally and new endemic areas. Monitoring vector and disease expansion in areas of recent colonization is needed to understand transmission mechanisms and patterns of disease establishment. Here, we studied the infection status of 815 human blood donors and of 803 sympatric dogs from five, newly endemic, areas in Northwestern Italy. In autochthonous dogs, the seroprevalence of anti-L.infantum antibodies, recorded by Western blot, reached 42.22%, while in humans, the seroprevalence was of 16.81%. No significant correlation between the infection status of dogs and that of their human owners was found, but L.infantum infection was recorded in the different study areas with significant levels of diversity. Restriction fragment length polymorphism showed a high genetic variability of the circulating strains and gave useful insights on patterns of disease establishment into a naive area."
Insect vectors of Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi) in Northeastern Brazil,"Introduction: Chagas disease remains a public health problem in the rural and urban areas of 19 countries in the Americas. Methods: The aim of the present study was to investigate the Trypanosoma cruzi infection rate of triatomines collected from both intra- and peridomiciliary areas in eleven municipalities of Southeastern Ceara, Brazil, from 2009 to 2015. Results: A total of 32,364 triatomine specimens, including nymphs and adults, were collected, and 31,736 (98.06%) of these were examined. More nymphs were collected than adults, and the greatest number of triatomines (n = 8,548) was collected in 2010, for which the infection rate was 1.3%, with the highest rate of infections observed for specimens from Quixere. The species collected during the study were identified as Triatoma pseudomaculata, Triatoma brasiliensis, Panstrongylus megistus, Panstrongylus lutzi, and Rhodnius nasutus, with T pseudomaculata being the most abundant (n = 19,962). Conclusions: These results verify the presence of triatomines in both intra- and peridomiciliary areas, thereby ensuring persistence of the pathogen and consequently, the disease, as the presence of infected vectors in households is an important risk factor. According to these findings, the Chagas Disease Control Program should intensify its efforts in order to prevent the spread of the disease."
Efficacy of an indirect immunofluorescence test in the diagnosis of canine leishmaniosis,Of 146 dogs from a visceral leishmaniosis-endemic area that tested seronegative by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) on blood samples collected on filter paper (IIFp) 51 (34 9%) and 10 (68%) tested positive by IIF on serum samples (IIFs) and enzyme immunoassay respectively Three samples (2 0%) tested positive by PCR Leishmania chagasi was isolated from the skin of five (3 4%) dogs Amastigote forms were identified in two of these five animals following histopathological and immunohistochemical examina non The findings highlight that detection methods such as IIFp can permit dogs infected with L chagasi to remain undetected in endemic areas with attendant consequences for the epidemiology of infection both in the canine and human populations (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved
CANINE VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS: STUDY OF METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF IgG IN SERUM AND ELUATE SAMPLES,"The Brazilian Ministry of Health recommends the culling and euthanasia of dogs with a positive serological test for canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). In the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, the technique used for the diagnosis of CVL is the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), using blood samples eluted on filter paper (eluate). A dog survey was conducted over a period of one year in the region of Carapia, in order to evaluate the diagnosis of CVL in this region. All animals underwent clinical examination, and blood samples (serum and eluate) were collected for analysis by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and IFAT. A skin biopsy was obtained for parasitological examination (culture). A total of 305 animals were studied and Leishmania chagasi was isolated from nine animals. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 96.6% for ELISA, respectively, 100% and 65.5% for IFAT (cut-off at a 1:40 dilution), 100% and 83.4% for IFAT (cut-off at a 1:80 dilution), and 22.2% and 97.0% for eluate IFAT. In conclusion, ELISA was the best tool for the diagnosis of CVL among the serological techniques tested. The present results suggest the need for a better evaluation of filter paper IFAT as the only diagnostic method for CVL in the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro."
Serological Diagnosis of Feline Tegumentary Leishmaniasis by Indirect Immunofluorescence (IFI) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) in an Endemic Area in Brazil,"Background: American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) is a serious public health problem, and the participation of domestic cats in its epidemiological process has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, the standardization of monitoring methodologies of cat populations becomes important for the generation of information on the disease. In Brazil, ATL presents a wide geographical distribution, being Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis its etiologic agent of ATL in Rio de Janeiro. The main objective of the present study was investigate the presence of specific anti-Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in 34 cats from an ATL endemic area in this municipality. Materials, Methods & Results: Sera from three cats from the study area naturally infected with Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis were used as positive control. Analyses were performed with antigen preparations using indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found prevalence rates of 20.6% (7/34) in the IFI and 14.7% (5/34) in the ELISA. Specificity was 87.1% for the IFI and 93.5% for the ELISA, and both tests presented sensitivity of 100%. Concordance between the used tests was assessed as moderate. Discussion: By conducting a feline serological survey in an endemic area for ATL we provide information on the involvement of this species in such epidemiological process. In this context, the participation of the cat in cycles of leishmaniases has been highlighted by several authors; infection of the phlebotomine by parasites originated from this vertebrate host can already be demonstrated by xenodiagnosis and several cases of feline infection have been reported in endemic regions of several countries such as Brazil, Spain, France, Portugal, Greece, Iran, Israel and Italy. Therefore, the standardization of diagnostic techniques that support the screening and monitoring of such populations becomes of utmost importance. In fact, the use of the IFI and ELISA serological techniques, showing sensitivity and NPV of 100%, confirm the use of such tools in epidemiological surveys for the detection of anti-L. (V.) braziliensis antibodies in domestic cats, and these methodologies are frequently employed in canine surveys showing good results. The serological titers found in this study for Leishmania (V.) braziliensis are similar to those of studies carried out with cats in endemic areas of visceral leishmaniasis in Spain. This similarity shows that the titers can be high even when L. (V.). braziliensis is the etiological agent. It is worth mentioning that these values are significant when compared with those of canine studies carried out in ATL endemic regions. Ultimately, the sample refers to an ATL endemic region located in Brazil, one of the countries with the highest endemicity levels of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the world and, therefore, an important area for the implementation and evaluation of diagnostic techniques for the generation of data on the disease and its possible hosts. Thus, the present study provides information on the occurrence of ATL by Leishmania (V.) braziliensis in domestic cats; demonstrates that the methodologies employed were favorable to the use of such techniques as tools in epidemiological surveys for the diagnosis of feline tegumentary leishmaniasis; and paves the way for further studies on the subject."
"Trypanosome infection in dromedary camels in Eastern Ethiopia: Prevalence, relative performance of diagnostic tools and host related risk factors","A cross-sectional study was conducted in Chifra and Dewe districts of Afar region, Eastern Ethiopia, to determine the prevalence, agreement between diagnostic tests and host related risk factors of trypanosome infection in camel. An overall prevalence of 2%, 24.1%, 21.3%, 9.5% and 7.8% was recorded with respectively Giemsa stained thin blood smear, CATT/T. evansi, RoTat1.2 PCR, 18S PCR and ITS-1PCR in a cohort of 399 animals. Only one T. vivax infection was confirmed by TvPRAC PCR indicating T. evansi as the predominant species affecting camels in the study area. No single animal was positive when tested with T. evansi type B specific EVAB PCR. There was slight agreement between the CATT/T. evansi and the molecular tests. Among the PCR methods, RoTat 1.2 PCR yielded a significantly higher positivity rate compared to 18S PCR and ITS-1 PCR. There was no significant difference in the positivity rate observed in each gender of camels (p > 0.05). The positivity rate was significantly higher in camels with poor body condition and in older animals when tested using the CATT/T.evansi or RoTat 1.2 PCR (p > 0.05). Camels that tested positive with all tests had significantly lower PCV's (p < 0.05). This study provides further evidence that T. evansi is endemic in the Afar region of Ethiopia. The latent class analysis indicated an estimate overall prevalence of 19% (95% CI: 13-28). Moreover, the model indicated low sensitivity of CATT/T. evansi (43%) and the PCR tests (39-53%) but higher specificity of the PCR tests (86-99%) and low specificity of CATT/T. evansi (80%). This study suggests that improved sensitivity and reliability of the tests would help diagnosis of trypanosomosis. Further studies are required to determine the prevalence of clinical disease and losses due to trypanosomosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Widespread occurrence of Trypanosoma vivax in bovines of tsetse- as well as non-tsetse-infested regions of Ethiopia: A reason for concern?,"A cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in some tsetse-infested and tsetse-free areas of Ethiopia. From August 2010 till April 2011, a total of 1524 animals were parasitologically examined and compared by the haematocrit centrifugation technique (Woo test) and polymerase chain reaction (ITS-1 PCR). The ITS-1 PCR was more sensitive and more accurate in species identification than the Woo test. In ITS-1 PCR, an overall trypanosome prevalence of 31.0% was observed that is significantly (P<0.001) higher than in the Woo test (5.3%). Trypanosoma vivax was the predominant taxon (24.9%), followed by T. theileri (6.0%), T. congolense (2.9%) and Trypanozoon (1.6%). Mixed infections were quite common (14% of all infections). The overall prevalence of trypanosome infections in tsetse area (32.4%) was not different from non-tsetse area (30.5%) neither were the prevalences of T. vivax in both areas (respectively 22.6% and 25.7%). With these high prevalences, bovine trypanosomosis continues to hinder animal production and productivity in Ethiopia, both in tsetse-infested and non-infested parts of the country. Attempts to control African trypanosomosis should also pay attention to mechanically transmitted pathogenic trypanosomes and should adopt the most advanced molecular tests for species identification.

Free-living ciliates as potential reservoirs for eukaryotic parasites: occurrence of a trypanosomatid in the macronucleus of Euplotes encysticus,"Background: Flagellates of the family Trypanosomatidae are obligate endoparasites, which can be found in various hosts. Several genera infect insects and occur as monoxenous parasites especially in representatives of Diptera and Hemiptera. These trypanosomatid flagellates probably share the worldwide distribution of their hosts, which are often infested by large numbers of endoparasites. Traditionally, their taxonomy was based on morphology, host origin, and life cycle. Here we report the characterization of a trypanosomatid infection detected in a protozoan, a ciliate collected from a polluted freshwater pond in a suburb of New Delhi (India). Methods: Live observations and morphological studies applying light, fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy were conducted. Molecular analyses of host and parasite were performed and used for phylogenetic reconstructions and species (host) or genus level (parasite) identification. Results: Although the morphological characteristics were not revealing, a high similarity of the trypanosomatids 18S rRNA gene sequence to Herpetomonas ztiplika and Herpetomonas trimorpha (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae), both parasites of biting midges (Culicoides kibunensis and Culicoides truncorum, respectively) allowed the assignment to this genus. The majority of the host population displayed a heavy infection that significantly affected the shape of the host macronucleus, which was the main site of parasite localization. In addition, the growth rate of host cultures, identified as Euplotes encysticus according to cell morphology and 18S rRNA gene sequence, was severely impacted by the infection. Conclusions: The host-parasite system described here represents a recent example of free-living protists acting as environmental reservoirs for parasitic eukaryotic microorganisms."
BLOOD PARASITES OF RAPTORS IN FLORIDA,"Fifteen species of blood protozoans and an unidentified microfilaria were found in thin blood films from 55 strigiforms and 138 falconiforms examined in Florida. All four of the species of strigiforms sampled were infected, with an overall hemoparasite prevalence of 63%, excluding nestlings. Seven of 11 species of falconiforms sampled were parasitized, with a prevalence of 33%, excluding nestlings. Mixed infections of two or more species occurred in 28 birds, 22 had two species of hemoparasites, three had three species, and three had four species. Among the infections of hemoparasites, Haemoproteus species were most common (67%), followed by Plasmodium (22%), Leucocytozoon (9%), Trypanosoma (1%), and microfilariae (1%). A Plasmodium (Nouyella) sp., previously known only from a barred owl (Strix varia) in Georgia, was present in the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), and broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus) in Florida. The identification of Leucocytozoon ziemanni is the first record of this species in barn owls (Tyto alba) from North America and Trypanosoma confusum is reported for the first time in a barred owl."
Recognition and Avoidance of Contaminated Flowers by Foraging Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris),"Bumblebee colonies are founded by a single-mated queen. Due to this life history trait, bumblebees are more susceptible to parasites and diseases than polyandrous and/or polygynous social insects. A greater resistance towards parasites is shown when the genetic variability within a colony is increased. The parasite resistance may be divided into different levels regarding the step of the parasite infection (e. g. parasite uptake, parasite intake, parasite's establishment in the nest, parasite transmission). We investigate the prophylactic behaviour of bumblebees. Bumblebees were observed during their foraging flights on two artificial flowers; one of these was contaminated by Crithidia bombi, a naturally occurring gut parasite of bumblebees (in a control experiment the non-specific pathogen Escherichia coli was used). For C. bombi, bumblebees were preferentially observed feeding on the non-contaminated flower. Whereas for E. coli, the number of visits between flowers was the same, bumblebees spent more time feeding on the non-contaminated flower. These results demonstrate the ability of bumblebees to recognise the contamination of food sources. In addition, bumblebees have a stronger preference for the non-contaminated flower when C. bombi is present in the other flower than with E. coli which might be explained as an adaptive behaviour of bumblebees towards this specific gut parasite. It seems that the more specific the parasite is, the more it reduces the reward of the flower."
The Rapid Test Based on Leishmania infantum Chimeric rK28 Protein Improves the Diagnosis of Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis by Reducing the Detection of False-Positive Dogs,"Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) has spread to many urban centers worldwide. Dogs are considered the main reservoir of VL, because canine cases often precede the occurrence of human cases. Detection and euthanasia of serologically positive dogs is one of the primary VL control measures utilized in some countries, including Brazil. Using accurate diagnostic tests can minimize one undesirable consequence of this measure, culling false-positive dogs, and reduce the maintenance of false-negative dogs in endemic areas. In December 2011, the Brazilian Ministry of Health replaced the ELISA (EIE CVL) screening method and Indirect Immunofluorescence Test (IFI CVL) confirmatory method with a new protocol using the rapid DPP CVL screening test and EIE CVL confirmatory test. A study of diagnostic accuracy of these two protocols was done by comparing their performance using serum samples collected from a random sample of 780 dogs in an endemic area of VL. All samples were evaluated by culture and real time PCR; 766 out of the 780 dogs were tested using the previous protocol (IFI CVL + EIE CVL) and all 780 were tested using the current protocol (DPP CVL + EIE CVL). Performances of both diagnostic protocols were evaluated using a latent class variable as the gold standard. The current protocol had a higher specificity (0.98 vs. 0.95) and PPV (0.83 vs. 0.70) than the previous protocol, although sensitivity of these two protocols was similar (0.73). When tested using sera from asymptomatic animals, the current protocol had a much higher PPV (0.63 vs. 0.40) than the previous protocol (although the sensitivity of either protocol was the same, 0.71). Considering a range of theoretical CVL prevalences, the projected PPVs were higher for the current protocol than for the previous protocol for each theoretical prevalence value. The findings presented herein show that the current protocol performed better than previous protocol primarily by reducing false-positive results."

"Prevalence and epidemiological significance of Trypanosoma cruzi infection among Latin American immigrants in Berlin, Germany","A survey was conducted among Latin American immigrants living in Berlin to investigate the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and to evaluate possible risk factors. One hundred persons were interviewed about risk factors (rural origin, contact,vith the reduviid bug) and evaluated serologically. The sera were tested with indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). All samples seroreactive with IIF were additionally evaluated with an ELISA for 2: cruzi antibodies. To rule out cross-reactivity all seroreactive sera were tested with IIF for Leishmania infantum antibodies. Two persons were seroreactive in IIF and ELISA and three were seroreactive in the LIF only. The overall seroprevalence according to WHO criteria was therefore 2% (2/100). All samples were negative for Leishmania antibodies. Only one of the seropositive persons showed a risk factor for T. cruzi infection in their medical history. These findings suggest that routine serologic testing of Latin Americans is indicated to reduce the risk of transmission by blood transfusion and congenital transmission."
"INVESTIGATIONS ON NATURALLY-OCCURRING TRYPANOSOMA-EVANSI INFECTIONS IN HORSES, CATTLE, DOGS AND CAPYBARAS (HYDROCHAERIS-HYDROCHAERIS) IN PANTANAL-DE-POCONE (MATO-GROSSO, BRAZIL)","The prevalence of Mal de Cadeiras - Portuguese for Trypanosoma (T.) evansi infections in horses - as well as the prevalence of T. evansi infections in cattle, dogs and free-ranging capybaras (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris) was investigated in Pantanal de Pocone (Mate Grosso, Brazil). In 0.3, 8.6 and 8.0% of the horses, dogs and capybaras, respectively, infection was detected using standard parasitological methods. A seroprevalence of 4.1, 2.3, 7.1 and 22.0% was found in horses, cattle, dogs and capybaras, respectively, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of T. evansi antigen (Ag-ELISA), whereas 9.6, 4.2, 18.6 and 14.0% of the animals investigated were reactive in a T. evansi antibody (Ab-) ELISA. Positive ELISA results ('high responders') were identified using computer-assisted mixture analysis (C.A.MAN). Agglutinating antibodies were detected by the T. evansi card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT/T. evansi) in 14.6%, 1.3%, 15.7% and 22.0% of the horses, cattle, dogs and capybaras, respectively. A moderate but significant (kappa test; p < 0.05) agreement beyond chance level was observed between Ab-ELISA and CATT results but generally not between antibody and antigen detection tests. Therefore, in an attempt to maximize the information yield of the three serodiagnostic tests, their results were numerically scored (negative=0, intermediate=1, positive=2) and added up to a total score (TS) which was considered indicative for infection when TS greater than or equal to 4 (results of the Ag-ELISA received double weight). Estimates of seroprevalence according to TS were 13.2, 4.7, 30.0 and 24.0% for horses, cattle, dogs and capybaras, respectively. Identical isoenzyme profiles, known as zymodeme 58 (T. evansi MCAN/BR/86/H), were found in all T. evansi stocks isolated in the study area (six from dogs, one from a horse and one from a capybara). From the results of this study it can be inferred that Mal de Cadeiras is endemic in Pantanal de Pocone. Although clinical and parasitological findings support the possible role of the capybara as a reservoir host of T. evansi, dogs and cattle - due to their close contact with horses should rather be regarded as efficient reservoir hosts for Mal de Cadeiras in the study area."
"Species diversity and flagellate infections in the sand fly fauna near Porto Grande, State of Amapa, Brazil (Diptera : Psychodidae. Kinetoplastida : Trypanosomatidae)","Forty-six species of Lutzomyia and one species of Brumptomyia were identified among 20,008 sandflies collected in central Amapa. L. squamiventris maripaensis, L. infraspinosa, L. umbratilis and L. ubiquitalis accounted for 66% of the specimens caught in light traps, and L. umbratilis was the commonest of the 16 species found on tree bases. Seven species of Lutzomyia including L. umbratilis were collected in a plantation of Caribbean pine. Sixty out of 511 female sandflies dissected were positive for flagellates. Among the sandflies from which Leishmania was isolated, promastigotes were observed in the salivary glands and foregut of 13 out of 21 females scored as having very heavy infections in the remainder of the gut, reinforcing the idea that salivary gland invasion may be part of the normal life cycle of Leishmania in nature. Salivary gland infections were detected in specimens of L. umbratilis, L. whimani and L. spathotrichia. Parasites isolated from L. umbratilis, L. whitmam and also from one specimen of L. dendrophyla containing the remains of a bloodmeal, were compatible with Le. guyanensis by morphology and behaviour in hamsters."
"Natural infection by Trypanosoma cruzi in triatomines and seropositivity for Chagas disease of dogs in rural areas of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil","Chagas disease is caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi. Its main reservoir is the domestic dog, especially in rural areas with favorable characteristics for vector establishment and proliferation. The aims of this study were to collect data. survey and map the fauna, and identify T cruzi infection in triatomines, as well as to assess the presence of anti-T cruzi antibodies in dogs in rural areas of the municipality of Mossoro, Brazil. Methods: An active entomologic research was conducted to identify adult specimens through an external morphology dichotomous key. The analysis of natural infection by T cruzi in the insects was performed by isolation in culture and polymerase chain reaction. The antibody testing for T cruzi in dogs was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence assay. Results: A total of 68 triatomines were captured, predominantly the Mama brasiliensis bras ilien.sis (Neiva 1911) species. The vector mapping displayed areas with greater risk for parasite transmission. Of the examined triatomines (51 specimens), 41.2% (21/51) were positive on polymerase chain reaction, and all were negative on culture. In the serum testing, 11% (25/218) of dogs were seropositive, but no association was found between the serologic results and the presence and infection by T cruzi in triatomines. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the movement of T cruzi in the studied area, by the presence of vectors and naturally infected domestic reservoirs. The mapping of the studied rural area demonstrates the risk of disease transmission."
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS AT A FOCUS MONITORED BY THE MULTINATIONAL FORCE AND OBSERVERS IN THE NORTHEASTERN SINAI DESERT OF EGYPT,"A longitudinal epidemiologic study of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) transmission was conducted between July 1989 and June 1991 in a 1,200-km2 sector of the northeastern Sinai Desert monitored by the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), an international peace keeping mission between Egypt and Israel. The occurrence of human cases, sand fly density, rodent collection, and isolations of Leishmania confirmed only one of four surveyed locations as a significant focus of CL transmission. Phlebotomus papatasi, the only anthropophilic sand fly species encountered at this focus, comprised more than 96% of the sand fly population and attained human landing densities exceeding 100 sand flies/person/hr during 1990. Seasonal activity of this species ranged from April to November, with highest densities occurring during the period May-September. A peak promastigote infection rate of 2.4% (13 of 534) was observed in P. papatasi during July 1990. Twelve of the 60 (20%) persons at risk during the six months of intense sand fly activity at this site developed lesions consistent with CL; L. major was isolated from nine (75%) of these cases. Leishmania major infection was acquired by two of 22 (9%) sentinel hamsters used during the same period. More than 97% of the 897 wild rodents trapped at this site were desert gerbil species. Leishmania major was the only Leishmania isolated from human, sand fly, wild rodent (Gerbillus pyramidum), and sentinel hamster infections that originated at site Check point 1-Delta, the focus of CL transmission within jurisdiction of the MFO. The altered ecology of this area, created by construction of a dam, may contribute significantly to the transmission dynamics of CL at this focus."
"Prevalence and Associated Factors of Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis in an Endemic Area of Mato Grosso, Brazil","Background: Canine visceral leishmaniasis is a chronic and severe disease of great interest to global public health. In Brazil, the main species causing visceral leishmaniasis is Leishmania chagasi [syn. Leishmania infantum], which is transmitted by sandflies of the species Lutzomyia longipalpis and Lu. cruzi. This study aimed to determine the risk factors and prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis in dogs residing in endemic areas of the municipality of Varzea Grande, Mato Grosso. Material, Methods & Results: The study was conducted in the Varzea Grande neighbourhoods Jardim Eldorado, Parque Sabia and Sao Mateus, which are located in the Brazilian Cerrado region and are endemic for visceral leishmaniasis. The Varzea Grande is a mostly commercial and industrial municipality and relies on subsistence farming. To describe the general characteristics of the dog population and housing environment, an interview was carried out with the dog owners in each household. This interview addressed local demographics and the identification of dogs to establish epidemiological aspects of canine illness and risk factors for infection. The dogs were examined and physically restrained for blood collection by jugular venipuncture. For serological testing, a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used. A Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to identify associations between independent variables and the seroprevalence of dogs with anti-Leishmania antibodies. It were collected blood from 521 animals, including 160 belonging to Jardim Eldorado, 129 to Parque Sabia and 232 to Sao Mateus. Of these animals, 120 were reactive by ELISA, with a prevalence of 23.0%. There was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) according to gender, age, racial definition, origin, time with family, presence of ectoparasites, or the presence of people with skin wounds at home or on other pets. The major risk factor for canine infection was fur length; dogs with short fur were 2.2 times more likely to be infected than dogs with long fur. Discussion: The prevalence of canine leishmaniasis in endemic areas was found to be similar to studies in Cuiaba, a city in Varzea Grande, which also included neighbourhoods endemic for visceral leishmaniasis as study areas. Other studies have shown prevalence rates that differ from those found in this study. This difference may either be because the neighbourhoods in this study had already experienced outbreaks of the disease or because serum samples were cross-reactive with other trypanosomatids. While infection was more readily detected in dogs with clinical signs, asymptomatic dogs with anti-Leishmania antibodies were found in greater numbers, which is consistent with the literature. Hair length was the only factor associated with canine leishmaniasis in this study; short-haired animals were most at risk of contracting the disease because they had more skin exposure to sandflies during blood feeding. In conclusion, endemic districts of Varzea Grande had high prevalence rates of canine visceral leishmaniasis, and a short length coat was associated with infection."
"Prevalence of a trypanosomatid in the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula","The southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.), and certain of its host plants were examined to determine the prevalence and biological characteristics of an intestinal trypanosomatid. Promastigotes with short (less than or equal to 17.5 mu m excluding flagellum) and long forms (greater than or equal to 25.0 mu m) usually infected < 50% of the bugs before August and > 50% (maximum 95%) during August-October, but prevalence was not host-density dependent. The flagellate was detected in adults and in all nymphal instars, at all sampling sites where at least 10 bugs were captured, and in bugs from all host plants sampled (soybean, red clover, vetch). Of bugs with flagellates, 27% were heavily infected (> 20 flagellates per 160x microscope field). Weights of infected and uninfected adults did not differ. Live flagellates were detected in bug feces and in one stem of red clover. When bugs were fed soybean pods, tomatoes, or snap beans in the laboratory, only once were flagellates detected in plant tissue (snap beans). The flagellate was cultured in modified Medium 199. This flagellate is prevalent in N. viridula populations in Louisiana and apparently does not cause significant pathological effects in N. viridula or its host plants, including soybean."
"Prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in dogs and small mammals in Nuevo Leon, Mexico","Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important public health concern in areas extending from South America northward into the southern United States of America. Although this hemoflagellate has many wild and domestic mammalians reported as reservoir hosts, studies on this subject are scarce in Nuevo Leon state, a region located in northeastern Mexico. This cross-sectional study showed that the general prevalence of T. cruzi infection in Nuevo Leon state was 14.5% (35/241), this percentage matching the ones determined by PCR and traditional diagnostics. Localities and infected mammals did not significantly differ (chi(2) = 6.098, p = 0.192); however the number of infected animals was highly correlated with mammalian species (p = 0.009). Striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) were found to be the most infected overall (11/34, 32.3%), while dogs (Canis familiaris) had the lowest prevalence. In conclusion, although the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in small mammals was lower in Nuevo Leon than in other states of Mexico, our results provide new locality records, including striped skunks, opossums (Didelphis marsupialis) and dogs, and extend the recorded area to woodrats (Neotoma micropus).

Emerging trends in the seroprevalence of canine leishmaniosis in the Madrid region (central Spain),"This report describes a cross-sectional serological survey of the epidemiology of canine leishmaniosis (CanL) performed in 2006 and 2007 in the Madrid region (central Spain) where the disease is endemic. The work presented here is one of the several studies conducted in different Spanish regions under the Integrated Project of the European Commission entitled Emerging Diseases in a changing European eNvironment (EDEN). The aim of this project is to identify and catalogue European ecosystems and environmental conditions that determine the spatial and temporal distributions and dynamics of several pathogenic agents including Leishmania infantum (EDEN-LEI). The study area (Madrid Autonomous Region) was selected on the grounds of its wide altitude range. This area was surveyed from NE to SW across its mountain range (Sistema Central) and plateau area. One thousand and seventy-six dogs from 32 villages were examined for clinical signs of CanL, and serum samples were obtained to determine several haematological and biochemical variables. Leishmaniosis-specific antibodies were identified using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). 87 of the 1076 dogs were seropositive for the protozoan (IFAT: cut-off >= 1/80) indicating a seroprevalence of 8.1% (0-16.1% depending on the village). On the basis of a physical examination and the biochemical/haematological status of each dog, 32 of the 87 infected dogs were described as clinically healthy (37%). Seroprevalence showed a peak in young dogs (1-2 years) and a second larger peak among the older dogs (7-8 years). Factors correlated with a higher infection risk were age (OR= 1.15 [95% Cl: 1.07-1.22]), weight (OR = 1.10 [95% Cl: 1.04-1.16]), and living outdoors as opposed to in a home (OR= 3.38 195% Cl: 1.42-8.05]). According to data from studies performed in 1992 in the same area, the seroprevalence of CanL has increased 1.54-fold [95% Cl: 1.04-2.29]. Given that this increasing trend cannot be attributed to differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of the dog populations, it is proposed that environmental changes could have had an impact on vector and reservoir densities and their geographical distributions. Further studies designed to explain this trend should attempt to correlate sand fly densities and CanL seroprevalences with climate, land use and human changes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Ecological parameters of the (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B population of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex in a visceral leishmaniasis area in Sao Paulo state, Brazil","Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important public health challenge in Brazil because of the high number of human and canine cases reported annually. Leishmania infantum is the etiological agent of VL and Lutzomyia longipalpis is its main vector. However, evidence suggests that this taxon constitutes a species complex. In Sao Paulo state, there are two populations of Lu. longipalpis, each secreting distinct pheromones, (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B and Cembrene 1; both have been associated with different patterns of VL transmission. The aim of the present study was to investigate the temporal distribution and natural infection of the (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B population of the Lu. longipalpis complex in a highly VL endemic area of Sao Paulo state to obtain information that may contribute to the surveillance of this zoonosis and to the planning of preventive and control measures. Methods: The study was carried out in Panorama municipality, Sao Paulo State. Captures were made during 24 months in seven domiciles. The relation between sand fly abundance and climatic variables, temperature and humidity, was analyzed and natural infection by Leishmania spp. in sand fly females was investigated by nested PCR. Results: A total of 4120 sand flies, with predominance of Lu. longipalpis (97.2%) were captured. The highest averages of sand flies/night/trap occurred in the rainy season (November-March) and a positive, significant correlation between sand fly abundance and the temperature and humidity 20 days before the capture days was found. Leishmania infantum DNA was detected in three out of 250 pools of females analyzed, giving an estimated minimum infection rate of 1.2%. Conclusion: The identification of the climatic association between the high abundance of the vector in this highly endemic VL focus constitutes a fundamental point for evaluating future vector and dog control measures and this information increases the data of VL foci in Sao Paulo state that could contribute to the public health authorities in planning prevention and control measures. The identification of natural infection by Le. infantum in Lu. longipalpis specimens reinforces the importance of entomological surveillance activities in this municipality."
Development of a LAMP assay for detection of Leishmania infantum infection in dogs using conjunctival swab samples,"Background: Leishmania infantum infections in dogs play a crucial role in the transmission of pathogens causing visceral leishmaniasis to humans in the Gansu province, northwest China. To be able to control zoonotic transmission of the parasite to humans, a non-invasive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to specifically detect L. infantum infections in dogs was developed. Methods: The primers used in the LAMP assay were designed to target kinetoplast DNA minicircle sequences of the L. infantum isolate MCAN/CN/90/SC and tested using DNA isolated from promastigotes of different Leishmania species. The LAMP assay was evaluated with conjunctional swab samples obtained from 111 and 33 dogs living in an endemic and a non-endemic region of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in the Gansu province, respectively. The LAMP assay was also compared with conventional PCR, ELISA and microscopy using conjunctional swab, serum and bone marrow samples from the dogs, respectively. Results: The LAMP assay detected 1 fg of L. infantum DNA purified from cultured promastigotes which was 10-fold more sensitive than a conventional PCR test using Leishmania genus-specific primers. No cross reaction was observed with DNA isolated from promastigotes of L. donovani, L. major, L. tropica, and L. braziliensis, and the L. infantum reference strain MHOM/TN/80/IPT1. The L. infantum-positive rates obtained for field-collected samples were 61.3 %, 58.6 %, 40.5 % and 10.8 % by LAMP, PCR, ELISA and microscopy, respectively. As only one out of the 33 samples from control dogs from the non-endemic region of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis was positive by the LAMP assay and the PCR test, the observed true negative rate (specificity) was 97 % for both methods. Conclusion: This study has shown that the non-invasive, conjunctional swab-based LAMP assay developed was more sensitive in the detection of leishmaniasis in dogs than PCR, ELISA and microscopy. The findings indicate that the LAMP assay is a sensitive and specific method for the field surveillance of domestic dogs, particularly of asymptomatic canines, in ZVL-endemic areas in western China."
Trypanosomiasis in Venezuelan water buffaloes: association of packed-cell volumes with seroprevalence and current trypanosome infection,"The seroprevalence of trypanosomiasis and the prevalence of current trypanosome infection in water buffaloes from the most important livestock areas of Venezuela were evaluated by IFAT and the microhaematocrit centrifugation technique, respectively. The usefulness of a PCR-based assay for identifying the trypanosome species in the buffaloes was also evaluated. Of the 644 animals investigated, 40 (6.2%) were found infected with trypanosomes by blood centrifugation, and 196 (30.4%) were found positive for anti-trypanosome antibodies, by IFAT. The results of the PCR-based assay indicated that 92.5% of the animals with current infections were infected with Trypanosoma vivax and the rest with T. theileri (the first molecular confirmation of T. theileri in Venezuelan water buffaloes). The national programme to treat and prevent trypanosome infections in the buffaloes does not appear to be meeting with great success, even though it is focused on T. vivax. Although the level of parasitaemia was categorized as low for 28 (70%) of the infections detected (and packed-cell volumes appeared to be unassociated with IFAT result, and uncorrelated, in the infected animals, with level of parasitaemia), the 40 infected buffaloes had a significantly lower mean packed-cell volume than the uninfected animals (P < 0.05). Farmers should therefore be made aware of the probability of trypanosome-attributable losses in buffalo productivity."
"Molecular characterization of Trypanosoma vivax in naturally-infected sheep from two farms at San Fernando and Biruaca Counties, Apure State, Venezuela","This study was made to achieve a molecular characterization of Trypanosoma vivax in two Venezuelan farms where both small ruminants (mainly ovines) and bovines (cattle and water buffaloes) share the same agroecological area. In addition, it was made to assess the role of sheep as source of T. vivax infection for cattle and buffalo herds. The microhematocrit centrifugation technique (MHC) was used to establish the percentage of current trypanosome infection. A PCR-based assay was used to confirm the species identification while a PCR-RFLP assay was used for studying intra-specific variation among T. vivax from sheep vs. those from other livestock from the same area. From 320 sheep blood samples, MHC detected 11 (4,35%) which is of remarkable epidemiological significance due to the low sensitivity of this method. Based on PCR results, T. vivax was characterized as the only species responsible for all sheep infections. All infected animals showed a lower packed cell volume value (P<0,05) when compared with the non-infected (22,435 vs. 31,450). The PCR-RFLP technique revealed similar profiles among T. vivax isolates suggesting a non intra-specific variation within the molecular marker amplified regardless the host (sheep water buffaloes or cattle). Thus, it was suggested that T. vivax infecting sheep, cattle, and buffaloes in the study area could be genetically closely related. These findings show that sheep may play an important role in the epidemiology of livestock trypanosomiasis in this area and they might be incorporated into therapeutic and preventive programs against livestock trypanosomiasis."

A serological survey of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in dogs of two urban areas of Mexico,"Five hundred and one dog sera from Cuernavaca, Morelos, and five hundred sera from Puebla, Puebla, Mexico were tested by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies. The overall prevalences were 8.8% (44 seropositives) in Cuernavaca and 24.2% (121 seropositives) in Puebla. The age-specific prevalences were calculated and the highest antibody prevalence in dogs from Cuernavaca was found in 7 year old dogs (19%) and in 8 year old dogs in Puebla (50%). Puppies in each city had greater than or equal to 10% seroprevalence. There was statistical significant association with male gender and longer length of haircoat with seroprevalence in Cuernavaca city but not in Puebla city. The presence of antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs suggests that there should be continuous awareness on the part of the Medical and Veterinary professions that the disease exists and that the transmission is occurring in urban areas of Mexico."
"Comparative diagnosis of parasitological, serological, and molecular tests in dourine-suspected horses","Study on comparative sensitivity of parasitological, serological, and molecular tests on 237 horses originating from two dourine-suspected districts of Arsi-Bale highlands of Ethiopia was conducted to determine the prevalence of the disease and degree of agreement of the diagnostic tests. Accordingly, the prevalence of the disease was found to be 4.6%, 36.7%, and 47.6% by parasitological Woo test, RoTat 1.2 and 18S PCR tests, respectively. The seroprevalence of the disease was 27.6% in CATT/Trypanosoma evansi test. In Ethiopia, it was for the first time that trypanosomes from dourine suspected horses were demonstrated in 4.6% of the animals using Woo test. The findings of the present study disclosed that dourine is highly prevalent and one of the major diseases of horses in the area. There was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) in prevalence of the disease between districts, sexes, and age groups of the animals. However, there was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in the prevalence of the disease between emaciated and animals with good body condition. Assessment of the degree of agreement of the diagnostic tests employed revealed low to fair (k - 0.1 - 0.4) with significantly higher sensitivity by PCR than other tests."
Prevalence of hematozoa in overwintering American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla): No evidence for local transmission,"We examined American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) for protozoan blood parasites on their wintering grounds to determine whether transmission of these parasites occurs prior to spring migration. A total of 73 blood smears from 37 birds were examined for presence and intensity of infection. Thirty-six birds were sampled in the fall, soon after arriving from northern breeding grounds, and the spring prior to departure. Two (5%) of the samples collected in the fall were positive for Haemoproteus fringillae and one (3%) had detectable infections of Trypanosoma avium. Individuals infected with H. fringillae were hatching year redstarts sampled in September and October. Intensity of infection was 78 and <1 infected erythrocytes per 10,000 erythrocytes, respectively. None of the birds had detectable infections when resampled prior to spring migration the following March."
HEMATOZOA FROM PASSERIFORM BIRDS IN LOUISIANA,"Blood smears were examined fro 935 individuals of 19 migrant and resident bird species collected in Lousiana. Of these, 320 (34.2%) harbored hematozoa. The prevalences of parasites were as follows: Haemoproteus spp. 22.8%, Trypanosoma spp. 6.9%, unidentified microfilariae 5.0%, Plasmodium spp. 3.4%, and Leucocytozoon spp. 1.3%. These data are consistent with other reports from the region. Infections were observed in 33% of the individuals in the 13 migrant species sampled and 33% of the individuals in the 6 resident species."
Blood parasites of Nearctic-Neotropical migrant passerine birds during spring trans-gulf migration: Impact on host body condition,"To test the hypothesis that migrants infected with blood parasites arrive on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico in poorer condition than uninfected birds, we examined 1,705 migrant passerine birds representing 54 species of 11 families from 2 Gulf Coast sites for blood parasites. Three hundred and sixty (21.1 %) were infected with 1 or more species of 4 genera of blood parasites. The prevalence of parasites was as follows: Haemoproteus spp. (11.7%), Plasmodium spp. (6.7%), LeucocytoZoon spp. (1.3%), and Trypanosoma spp. (1.2%). Both prevalence and density of Haemoproteus spp. infection varied among species. We found no relationship of gender or age with the prevalence of Haemoproteus spp. infection or Plasmodium spp. infection, with the exception of the orchard oriole (Icterus spurius) for which older birds were more likely to be infected with Haemoproteus spp. than younger birds. We also found that scarlet tanagers and summer tanagers infected with species of Haemoproteus have lower fat scores than uninfected individuals and that rose-breasted grosbeaks and Baltimore orioles infected with Haemoproteus spp. have a smaller mean body mass than uninfected individuals. Blood parasites do seem to pose a physiological cost for Neotropical migrant passerines and may be important components of the ecology of these species."
Domestic dog ownership in Iran is a risk factor for human infection with Leishmania infantum,"One explanation proposed for the widespread failure to control zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis by culling infected domestic dogs is that wild canids or humans play significant roles in transmission. The aim of this study was to determine the importance of domestic dogs as the reservoir hosts of visceral leishmaniasis in northwest Iran. A random sample of 3,872 children and 199 dogs in 38 villages was surveyed by the direct agglutination test. Dog ownership details among these households were collected by questionnaire. Parasites isolated from 16 patients and 12 dogs were characterized as Leishmania infantum MON-1. Average seroprevalence in dogs (21.6%) was much higher than in children (7%). Child seropositivity increased significantly with village dog density in absolute terms (P < 0.001) and in relation to dog/human ratios (P = 0.028). Dog ownership within villages also was a significant risk factor for child seropositivity (P = 0.003)."
"The isolation of Leishmania tropica and L. aethiopica from Phlebotomus (Paraphlebotomus) species (Diptera : Psychodidae) in the Awash Valley, northeastern Ethiopia","In a survey of Leishmania infections in phlebotomine sandflies in a highly suspected focus of leishmaniasis in the Awash Valley (northeastern Ethiopia) between January 1994 and August 1997, a total of 3307 females of 11 Phlebotomus species (P. orientalis, P. fantalensis, P. saevus, P. sergenti, P. gemetchi, P. alexandri, P. bergeroti, P. duboscqi, P. arabicus, P. martini, and P. rodhaini) were dissected. Promastigotes were detected in 17 females of three species (11 P. saevus, 4 P. sergenti and 2 P. arabicus). Of these, only two P. soevus (one from Upper Awash and one from Middle Awash) and three P. sergenti (from Upper Awash) positives were successfully isolated in culture and were typed by isoenzyme analysis. Four isolates (two each from P. saevus and P. sergenti) were identified as new zymodemes (Z) of L. tropica and one isolate from P. sergenti was typed as a new zymodeme of L. aethiopica. This is the first finding of natural infections of P saevus and P arabicus and the first evidence for the former to be a vector of L. tropica. This is also the first time P. sergenti has been implicated in L. tropica transmission in Ethiopia; the isolation of L. aethiopica from a Paraphlebotomus species (P. sergenti) is also a new record. The possible presence of human cutaneous leishmaniasis (L. tropica and L. aethiopica), and wild reservoir host(s) of the parasites, especially rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) in the Upper and Middle Awash Valley remain to be determined.

Evaluation of Trypanosama evansi prevalence and risk factors in the one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) of the north-east of Iran by a real-time PCR test,"The Surra caused by Trypanosoma evansi (T. evansi) is an economically damaging disease of livestock including camels, horses, and buffaloes. The disease is transmitted by arthropod flies belonging to family tabanidae. The clinical signs of affected animals include recurrent fever, progressive anemia, cachexia, edema, and abortion. In order to determine the point prevalence of Surra in the camel population of north-east of Iran, 152 blood samples from one-humped camels were collected by multiple cluster sampling methods from three provinces, namely, Razavi Khorasan (R.Kh.), Northern Khorasan (N.Kh.), and Southern Khorasan (S.Kh.). The nucleic acid extracted from the bully coat of each blood sample was analyzed by SYBR green real-time PCR test for the detection of T. evansi in the blood samples. T. evansi was detected in 10 out of 152 camel blood samples (6.5%) with a prevalence rate of 8.6, 9.3, and 1.4 percent in R.Kh., N.Kh., and S.Kh. provinces, respectively. The prevalence of the disease decreased from north to south in the Khorasan provinces. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that among risk factors influencing Surra in the camel population, location was the most remarkable risk factor. Different geographical conditions, climate change, and the amount of raining can be considered as the factors affecting Surra vector population from north to south, resulting in a decrease in the rate of the prevalence of Surra from north to south."
Genotype Profile of Leishmania major Strains Isolated from Tunisian Rodent Reservoir Hosts Revealed by Multilocus Microsatellite Typing,"Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by Leishmania (L.) major parasites represents a major health problem with a large spectrum of clinical manifestations. Psammomys (P.) obesus and Meriones (M.) shawi represent the most important host reservoirs of these parasites in Tunisia. We already reported that infection prevalence is different between these two rodent species. We aimed in this work to evaluate the importance of genetic diversity in L. major parasites isolated from different proven and suspected reservoirs for ZCL. Using the multilocus microsatellites typing (MLMT), we analyzed the genetic diversity among strains isolated from (i) P. obesus (n = 31), (ii) M. shawi (n = 8) and (iii) Mustela nivalis (n = 1), captured in Sidi Bouzid, an endemic region for ZCL located in the Center of Tunisia. Studied strains present a new homogeneous genotype profile so far as all tested markers and showed no polymorphism regardless of the parasite host-reservoir origin. This lack of genetic diversity among these L. major isolates is the first genetic information on strains isolated from Leishmania reservoirs hosts in Tunisia. This result indicates that rodent hosts are unlikely to exert a selective pressure on parasites and stresses on the similarity of geographic and ecological features in this study area. Overall, these results increase our knowledge among rodent reservoir hosts and L. major parasites interaction."
Leishmania Major Infection Among Psammomys Obesus and Meriones Shawi: Reservoirs of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Sidi Bouzid (Central Tunisia),"A study was undertaken between November 2008 and March 2010, in the focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis of Central Tunisia, to evaluate the role of Psammomys obesus (n = 472) and Meriones shawi (n = 167) as reservoir hosts for Leishmania major infection. Prevalence of L. major infection was 7% versus 5% for culture (p = not signifiant [NS]), 19% versus 16% for direct examination of smears (p = NS), and 20% versus 33% (p = NS) for Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test among P. obesus and M. shawi, respectively. The peak of this infection was in winter and autumn and increased steadily with age for the both species of rodents. The clinical examination showed that depilation, hyper-pigmentation, ignition, and severe edema of the higher edge of the ears were the most frequent signs observed in the study sample (all signs combined: 47% for P. obesus versus 43% for M. shawi; p = NS). However, the lesions were bilateral and seem to be more destructive among M. shawi compared with P. obesus. Asymptomatic infection was similar to 40% for both rodents. This study demonstrated that M. shawi plays an important role in the transmission and the emergence of Leishmania major cutaneous leishmaniasis in Tunisia."
"Molecular investigation and geographical distribution of Leishmania spp infection in stray and owned cats (Felis catus) in Thessaly, central Greece","In this study we aimed to determine the prevalence of Leishmania spp infection and to report the geographical distribution of Leishmania spp infected cats from Thessaly, central Greece, an endemic region for canine and human leishmaniosis. Blood samples were collected from a total of 150 cats (34 stray and 116 owned) from the area of Thessaly, i.e. Larissa (n=6), Volos (n=94), Trikala (n=30) and Karditsa (n=20). Data on signalment and living conditions were registered for each cat. The samples were tested by Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 nested PCR (ITS1 nested PCR). Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to define the geographical distribution of the Leishmania spp infected cats in relation to the land uses and the altitude. In total, 13.3% (95% CI: 8.3-19.8) of the sampled cats were found positive for Leishmania spp DNA. More precisely, the results are 12.8% (95% CI 6.8-21.2) in Volos, 20% (95% CI 6.8-21.2) in Trikala and 10% (95% CI 12-31.7) in Karditsa while none of the six cats examined from the region of Larissa was found PCR positive. The Leishmania spp infected cats were found in artificial surfaces and associated areas and in cultivated and managed areas with a mean altitude of 81,7 m above sea level (range 14 - 225 +/- 51.57 SD). No significant correlation was found between Leishmania spp infection and signalment or living conditions, thus suggest ing that the infection is uniformly distributed among the screened feline population. The findings of this study along with the occurrence of competent vectors of Leishmania infantum in Thessaly, support the hypothesis that cats may serve as a reservoir for Leishmania spp in this region and highlight the need for surveillance in feline population and implementation of control measures. However, the epidemiological role of cats in the maintenance and transmission of Leishmania spp has yet to be defined and deserves further investigation."
Prevalence of antibodies and cell mediated immune response against Leishmania major in feral nonhuman primates from Kenya,"In Kenya, Leishmania major is responsible for human cutaneous leishmaniasis(CL). Natural infection with L. major of a vervet monkey and experimental susceptibility of some nonhuman primates (NHPs) from Kenya has been established. However, there has been no comprehensive study of the prevalence of zoonotic CL in Kenya. And also, no investigation has been done to assess whether NHPs could be potential reservoir hosts of L. major even when the involvement of reservoir animals is obligatory in transmission of this parasite. To achieve this, wild caught Chlorocebus aethiops (Vervet monkeys n = 213). Papio cynocephalus anubis (olive baboons n = 101) and Cercopithecus mitis (Syke's monkeys it = 64) from five geographical locations in Kenya were screened for antibodies against L. major using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot (WB) analysis. From the population of C. aethiops (n = 213) captured, 57 were used in lymphocyte proliferation assay. ELISA revealed a high prevalence of leishmaniasis sero conversion in olive baboons 78/101 (77.2%), vervet monkeys 129/213 (60.6%) and Sykes' monkeys 43/64 (67.2%). WB detected anti-L. major antibodies in 48.5% (49/101) of the baboons, 48% (102/213) of vervet monkeys and 37.5% (24/64) of Sykes' monkey sera. Specific proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to L. major antigen was demonstrated ill 17 of the 57 (29.8%) vervet monkeys. In conclusion, the results of serological assays provide strong circumstantial evidence that CL is prevalent in five Provinces of Kenya and that Kenyan NHPs Could be could be a potential reservoir hosts of L. major.

Factors affecting parasite prevalence among wild bumblebees,"2. This study used a 2-year multi-site survey of bumblebee parasitism to ask: (i) how common are parasitoid conopid flies and the internal parasites Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi in Massachusetts; and (ii) what factors are correlated with parasitism? 3. Infection rates by all three parasites were higher in this study than previously documented in North America. Overall, conopids infected 0-73% of bees in each sample, C. bombi infected 0-82% of bees, and N. bombi infected 0-32%. 4. Conopid flies infected female bees more than males and intermediate-sized bees more than large or small bees. Crithidia bombi infection rates were higher in certain bee species and sites, and exhibited a unimodal pattern of prevalence over time. Nosema bombi parasitism was higher in male than female bees. 5. Infection by N. bombi in two rare bumblebee species was higher than expected based on parasitism rates of common bee species but C. bombi infection was lower. If high prevalence of N. bombi in these bumblebee species is common, parasitism may be a potential cause of their decline. 6. Given the documented effects of these parasites, the high levels of infection may affect bee populations in Massachusetts and threaten the stability of their valuable ecosystem services."
"Prevalence of mixed Trypanosoma congolense infections in livestock and tsetse in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","Trypanosoma congolense causes the most economically important animal trypanosomosis in Africa. In South Africa, a rinderpest pandemic of the 1890s removed many host animals, resulting in the near-eradication of most tsetse species. Further suppression was achieved through spraying with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT); however, residual populations of Glossina austeni and C. brevipalpis remained in isolated pockets. A total of 506 of these tsetse flies were captured in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, the St Lucia Wetland Park and Boomerang commercial farm. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the infection rate and frequency of mixed infections of these flies. Additionally, 473 blood samples were collected from cattle at communal diptanks and a commercial farm in the area and each one examined by the haematocrit centrifugation technique (HCT). Furthermore, buffy coats from these blood samples were spotted onto FTA Elute cards and the DNA extracted from each one tested using 3 separate PCRs. The HCT revealed the presence of trypanosomes in only 6.6% of the blood samples; by contrast, species-specific PCR detected trypanosome DNA in 50% of the samples. The species-specific PCR detected trypanosome DNA in 17 % of the tsetse flies, compared with the nested PCR targeting rDNA which detected trypanosome DNA in only 14 % of the samples. Over time, the transmission of Savannah-type T congolense and Kilifi-type T congolense as mixed infections could have an impact on disease manifestation in different hosts in the area."
"Epidemiologic Aspects of an Emerging Focus of Visceral Leishmaniasis in Tbilisi, Georgia","Background: Over the last 15 years, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has emerged as a public health concern in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. Methodology/Principal Findings: Seroepidemiological surveys were conducted to determine the prevalence and incidence of infection in children and dogs within the main focus of VL, and to identify risk factors associated with human infection. Of 4,250 children investigated, 7.3% were positive by direct agglutination test in a baseline survey; an apparent incidence rate of 6.0% was estimated by one year follow-up. None of the seropositive children progressed to VL during the survey. Increased seropositivity at one year was predicted by presence at baseline of clustered flying insects (OR = 1.49; P = 0.001), perceived satisfactory sanitation (OR = 1.65; P<0.001), stray dogs (OR = 1.33; P = 0.023), and by persistent fever during the 6 months prior to baseline survey (OR = 14.2; P<0.001). Overall, 18.2% (107/588) of domestic and 15.3% (110/718) of stray dogs were seropositive by the rk39 dipstick test. Clinical VL signs were found in 1.3% of domestic and 2.9% of stray, seropositive dogs. Parasites isolated from human and dog samples were identified by PCR and phylogenetic analysis of the Leishmania 70 kDa heat-shock protein (HSP70) gene as Leishmania infantum. Conclusions/Significance: There is an active focus of L. infantum transmission in Tbilisi with a high prevalence of human and canine infections."
"Simultaneous Detection of Parasitic Vector Borne Diseases: A Robust Cross-Sectional Survey in Hunting, Stray and Sheep Dogs in a Mediterranean Area","Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are a spectrum of diseases caused by different pathogens transmitted by blood-feeding arthropoda. The aim of this study was to investigate leishmaniosis, babesiosis, and filarial infections in dogs with three different lifestyles (hunting, stray, and sheep dogs) in Molise, the smallest region of southern Italy, where data available about these parasitic infections are very scant. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 318 hunting, 180 stray, and 218 sheep dogs. Immunofluorescence antibody test, blood smear, molecular techniques and Knott's test were performed to detect Leishmania infantum, Babesia spp. and filarial nematodes. Association between positivity to CVBDs, age, sex, and living conditions was evaluated. An overall prevalence of 12.3% of CVBDs caused by L. infantum (10.2%), B. canis canis (0.3%) and filarial nematodes (2.1%) was detected. Three dogs showed co-infections of L. infantum and B. c. canis (0.1%) or Acanthocheilonema reconditum (0.3%). A significantly association was found only for filarial infection in hunting dogs. These parasites were reported also in dogs without clinical signs. It is very important to plan effective control programs for CVBDs to guarantee not only the health and welfare of pets, but also the public safety, because some of mentioned parasites are of zoonotic importance."
A PCR-based survey on Phytomonas (Euglenozoa : Trypanosomatidae) in phytophagous hemipterans of the Amazon region,"We have surveyed 244 hemipterans from Western Brazilian Amazonia for the presence of trypanosomatids and identification of members of the genus Phytomonas. Examination by phase microscopy of squashes of insect salivary glands (SG) and digestive tubes (DT) revealed that 44% (108/244) of insects from seven families harbored trypanosomatids. Infections were 5 times more frequent in Coreidae than in all other families together. Smears of SG and DT of the dissected insects were fixed on glass slides with methanol and stained with Giemsa for morphological analysis. DNA was recovered from these preparations and submitted to a PCR assay that permitted amplification of all trypanosomatid genera using primers of conserved sequences flanking a segment of the spliced leader (SL) gene. Upon PCR amplification of the recovered DNA, amplicons were hybridized with an oligonucletide probe (SLY) complementary to a SL intron sequence specific for flagellates of the genus Phytomonas. Among the trypanosomatid-positive insects, 38.8% harbored Phytomonas spp., corresponding to an overall Phytomonas prevalence of 17.1% among phytophagous bugs, their putative vectors. Since many Phytomonas are pathogenic in plants, this high prevalence in their vectors emphasizes the permanent risk of exposure to disease by native and cultured plants of the Amazon region."
"Prevalence of triatomines (Hemiptera : Reduviidae : Triatominae) infected by Trypanosoma cruzi: seasonality and distribution in the Cienega region of the State of Jalisco, Mexico","The physical and geographical characteristics of the Cienega region, Jalisco, Mexico make it suitable for transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent for Chagas disease. This study characterizes the prevalence of triatomines infected by this parasite, their seasonality and their distribution in this region. A total of 328 triatomines were evaluated between January 2005 and June 2007, from 13 municipalities in the region. April, May and June were the months with the highest capture levels. Among the triatomines examined, 57.3% were positive for Trypanosoma cruzi, corresponding to 15.4% in urban areas and 84.6% in rural areas. The species with greatest prevalence was Triatoma longipennis and the species with the highest parasitism rate was Triatoma barberi, with an infection rate of 83.3%, whereas the rate for Triatoma longipennis was 67.5% (p < 0.05). This natural infection in the captured vectors may indicate that individuals in this region have high exposure to Trypanosoma cruzi. The recent findings of positive Triatoma dimidiata in this region suggest that new species are becoming adapted to the ecological conditions of these populations."
"Surveillance of Chagas disease vectors in municipalities of the state of Ceara, Brazil","The present study aimed to analyse the dwelling infestation rates and the distribution and natural Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates, among triatomines captured in the 13 municipalities of the state of Ceara. The records relating to the capture of intradomicile and peridomicile triatomines during the Chagas disease control program of 19982008 were available. Among the triatomines captured and in all of the municipalities studied, Triatoma brasiliensis presented the highest incidence in intradomicile and Triatoma pseudomaculata in peridomicile and some were positive for infection by T. cruzi. We emphasise that it is important to have sustainable epidemiological surveillance in the region, since when the control measures decreased, the incidence of T. pseudomaculata in intradomicile grew."
"Epidemiological studies of an outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Rio Jequitinhonha Valley, Minas Gerais, Brazil","We detected an outbreak of American cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Jequitinhonha River Valley, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Clinical and epidemiological aspects were studied for a period of two years, Data include results of physical examinations, Montenegro skin test and serology. In total 72 of the 299 individuals evaluated presented active lesions. Only one case out of these 72 patients showed the mucosal form of the disease. The precarious sanitary conditions, low educational level and low income found in the population studied demonstrated that, as with the other parasitic diseases, cutaneous leishmaniasis occurs with greater frequency in needy populations. A canine serological survey detected 20.3% (30/148) of dogs reactive to the Leishmania antigen. Lutzomyia intermedia was the predominant phlebotomine species and the majority of the specimens (84.90%) were captured in the peridomicile. Four samples from human and three from canine cases were isolated and characterised by PCR and isoenzymes as being Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. The peridomiciliary nature of the disease is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
Bovine trypanosomosis in the Bolivian pantanal,"Trypanosomosis caused by Trypanosoma vivax has been a constraint for cattle production in the Bolivian lowlands, since it was introduced in 1996. Flooded areas like the Bolivian Pantanal have a suitable environment for the presence and transmission of Salivarian trypanosomes and farmers from that region often report trypanosomosis-like problems on their farms. The objective of the present study, therefore, was to characterize the epidemiology of bovine trypanosomosis in the Bolivian Pantanal. In order to achieve this objective, 202 cattle from the province of Angel Sandoval and 209 cattle from the province of German Busch were randomly sampled (the Pantanal is located in both provinces). Twenty-nine farms in both provinces were visited, the farmers interviewed, and biologic samples collected from their cattle. Samples were submitted for parasitological and PCR evaluation and the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis was estimated for each province. Laboratory results were correlated with the sampled animals packed cell volume (PCV) and body condition (BC) scones and the observed T. vivax parasites measured for morphometry analysis. Results from this study show differences in morphometric measures between T. vivax parasites from each province. Differences between provinces were also observed in the T. vivax-related disease situation. While in Angel Sandoval the PCV and BC of T. vivax-affected animals were significantly lower than those of the T. vivax-negative animals, in German Busch no differences were observed in the PCV and BC of T. vivax-positive or negative animals. Animal prevalence of T. vivax in Angel Sandoval was 27.79% (95% CI: 14.52-44.28) and in German Busch was 19.03% (95% CI: 9.19-30.75). The T. evansi animal prevalence in each province was 0.99% (95% CI: 0.27-2.99) and 5.71% (95% CI: 2.43-12.19), respectively. Based on questionnaire and laboratory results, it was concluded that trypanosomosis is a primary constraint for cattle production in the Bolivian Pantanal. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Trypanosomosis prevalence in cattle on Mafia Island (Tanzania),"During two consecutive surveys (February and August/Sept 2002), a total of 970 cattle from the cattle population of Mafia Island (United Republic of Tanzania) were blood-sampled. All blood samples were microscopically screened for the presence of trypanosomes and a portion of these were checked for antibodies with an Ab-ELISA and for the presence of trypanosomal DNA with PCR. Microscopic evidence of trypanosomes of the congolense group (sub-genus Nannomonas) was found in 0.8% of the animals (8/970) and in two cases the species identified was confirmed by PCR as Trypanosoma congolense savannah type. Nonpathogenic Trypanosoma theileri were detected in 3.2% (31/970) of the samples using the Dark Ground-Buffy Coat (DG-BC) technique. For survey 1 (S 1), detection of antibodies (Ab-ELISA) against pathogenic trypanosomes indicated a seroprevalence of 14.2% (68/480). Of the samples, either DG positive or with a PCV lower then 25, examined by PCR, a total of 8.4% (5/59) (selected from 970 samples), were found positive for T congolense. The low prevalence of pathogenic trypanosomes on Mafia Island is intriguing, especially in view of the omnipresence of the tsetse fly Glossina brevipalpis. Although the presence of detected trypanosomal antibodies does not necessarily indicate a current infection, the combination of serological/parasitological examinations and the results of the PCR do support this low prevalence of trypanosomosis in cattle. Despite the low prevalence, pathogenic trypanosomes are present on Mafia Island and possible reasons for this low infection rate, taking account of the relation between Glossina species present, transmission risk and trypanosomes found in cattle, are discussed also in view of a future appropriate intervention strategy.

"Trypanosoma cruzi Infection Prevalence and Bloodmeal Analysis in Triatomine Vectors of Chagas Disease From Rural Peridomestic Locations in Texas, 2013-2014","Protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas, 1909) is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, which affects millions of people in Latin America. Recently, the disease has been gaining attention in Texas and the southern United States. Transmission cycle of the parasite involves alternating infection between insect vectors and vertebrate hosts (including humans, wildlife, and domestic animals). To evaluate vector T. cruzi parasite burden and feeding patterns, we tested triatomine vectors from 23 central, southern, and northeastern counties of Texas. Out of the 68 submitted specimens, the majority were genetically identified as Triatoma gerstaeckeri (Stal, 1859), with a few samples of Triatoma sanguisuga (LeConte, 1855), Triatoma lecticularia (Stal, 1859), Triatoma rubida (Uhler, 1894), and Triatoma protracta woodi (Usinger, 1939). We found almost two-thirds of the submitted insects were polymerase chain reaction-positive for T. cruzi. Bloodmeal sources were determined for most of the insects, and 16 different species of mammals were identified as hosts. The most prevalent type of bloodmeal was human, with over half of these insects found to be positive for T. cruzi. High infection rate of the triatomine vectors combined with high incidence of feeding on humans highlight the importance of Chagas disease surveillance in Texas. With our previous findings of autochthonous transmission of Chagas disease, urgent measures are needed to increase public awareness, vector control in and around homes, and Chagas screening of residents who present with a history of a triatomine exposure."
"Ticks and haemoparasites of dogs from Praia, Cape Verde","In February 2008 an epidemiological field study on arthropod-borne infections in dogs was carried out in Praia, the capital city of Cape Verde. For this purpose 130 dogs were included in the study. Of these, 94.6% were infested with ticks. Altogether, 1293 ticks of the genus Rhipicephalus (in all evaluated cases R. sanguineus) were collected. Examination for haemotropic parasites was performed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Lymph node fine-needle aspirates were screened by PCR for Leishmania infantum infections in 20 dogs with enlarged lymph nodes. Our investigation revealed two species of protozoa (Babesia canis vogeli and Hepatozoon canis) and two species of rickettsiae (Anaplasma platys and Ehrlichia canis). In 101 dogs (77.7%) DNA of one or more pathogens was detected. The PCR examination for H. canis was positive in 83 dogs (63.8%), for E. canis in 34 dogs (26.2%), for A. platys in 10 dogs (7.7%) and for B. canis in five dogs (3.8%), whereas neither B. gibsoni nor L. infantum DNA could be detected. Of the infected dogs, 71.3% had a monoinfection, 27.7% had infections with two pathogens and 1.0% with three pathogens. B. canis, H. canis, E canis, A. platys and their vector tick R. sanguineus are endemic to Cape Verde and can be present in dogs in high prevalences. These results outline the risk of importing tropical canine diseases when Capeverdian stray dogs are taken to Europe. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
The impacts of predators and parasites on wild bumblebee colonies,"1. The study of wild bumblebee nests has been hindered by the difficulty in locating and observing them. Here, 47 wild nests were located using a sniffer dog and volunteers. The entrances to 32 nests were filmed continuously to identify successful nests (those that produced gynes) and observe vertebrate species interactions. 2. Of the 47 nests, 71% and 21% produced gynes in 2010 and 2011, respectively. 3. A total of 39 vertebrate species were filmed at entrances but the majority did not interact with the nests. Great tits (Parus major) depredated or attempted to depredate bees on 32 occasions at the entrances to 10 nests, something that has not previously been described. Small mammals were very often recorded accessing entrances to bumblebee nests, but whether they depredated bees was not known, and frequently visited nests were no less likely to produce gynes. Eight nests were entered by adult wax moths, Aphomia sociella. 4. The faeces of 1179 workers from 29 Bombus terrestris nests were screened microscopically for parasites. Crithidia bombi infections were apparent in 49% of worker bees, while Nosema bombi and Apicystis bombi were present in 5.5% and 0.68% of bees, respectively. Nests with a high prevalence of C. bombi infection were less likely to produce gynes, the first evidence of a direct impact of this common parasite on bumblebee colony reproduction in wild nests. 5. Overall, our data indicate that bumblebee nests are at the heart of a rich web of interactions between many different predator and parasite species."
Influence of urbanisation on the prevalence of protozoan parasites of bumblebees,"1. Increasing urbanisation is often cited as a cause of declining biodiversity, but for bumblebees there is evidence that urban populations of some species such as Bombus terrestris L. may be more dense than those found in agricultural landscapes, perhaps because gardens provide plentiful floral resources and nesting opportunities. 2. Here we examine the influence of urbanisation on the prevalence of the main protozoan parasites of bumblebees in west central Scotland. We would expect transmission rates and prevalence of parasites to be higher in high density host populations, all else being equal. 3. Workers of two bee species, B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, were sampled over a 45-day period in mid to late summer, and parasites were detected in faeces and via dissection. A comparison of the two methods suggests that faecal sampling is considerably less sensitive than dissection, failing to detect infection in 27.8%, 55.1%, and 80% of cases of infection with the parasites Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, and Apicystis bombi, respectively. 4. For all three parasites, broad patterns of prevalence were similar, with prevalence tending to increase with urbanisation in B. terrestris but not in B. pascuorum. The different patterns of seasonal prevalence in the two bee species suggest that intraspecific transmission is more important that interspecific transmission. 5. Our observation of greater parasite prevalence among B. terrestris in urban compared with rural areas suggests that urban habitats may present greater opportunities for parasite transmission. Greater bee densities in urban areas may be the driving factor; however, further study is still needed. For example, differences in disease prevalence between habitats could be driven by differences in the types and abundance of flowers that are available, or in exposure to environmental stressors."
The relationship between managed bees and the prevalence of parasites in bumblebees,"Honey bees and, more recently, bumblebees have been domesticated and are now managed commercially primarily for crop pollination, mixing with wild pollinators during foraging on shared flower resources. There is mounting evidence that managed honey bees or commercially produced bumblebees may affect the health of wild pollinators such as bumblebees by increasing competition for resources and the prevalence of parasites in wild bees. Here we screened 764 bumblebees from around five greenhouses that either used commercially produced bumblebees or did not, as well as bumblebees from 10 colonies placed at two sites either close to or far from a honey bee apiary, for the parasites Apicystis bombi, Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, N. ceranae, N. apis and deformed wing virus. We found that A. bombi and C. bombi were more prevalent around greenhouses using commercially produced bumblebees, while C. bombi was 18% more prevalent in bumblebees at the site near to the honey bee apiary than those at the site far from the apiary. Whilst these results are from only a limited number of sites, they support previous reports of parasite spillover from commercially produced bumblebees to wild bumblebees, and suggest that the impact of stress from competing with managed bees or the vectoring of parasites by them on parasite prevalence in wild bees needs further investigation. It appears increasingly likely that the use of managed bees comes at a cost of increased parasites in wild bumblebees, which is not only a concern for bumblebee conservation, but which may impact other pollinators as well."
Seroprevalence and risk factors for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in the amazon region of Ecuador,"Trypanosoma cruzi infection in the Ecuadorian Amazon region has recently been reported. A seroepidemiologic survey conducted in four provinces in this region indicates a seroprevalence rate of 2.4% among the 6,866 samples collected in 162 communities. Among children less than or equal to10 years of age, 1.2% were seropositive. Risk factors for T. cruzi seropositivity were having been born and remaining in the Ecuadorian Amazon provinces, age, living in a house with a thatch roof and open or mixed wall construction, recognizing the vector insects, and reporting being bitten by a triatomine bug. These data suggest active transmission of Chagas' disease in the Ecuadorian Amazon region is associated with poor housing conditions, and highlight the need for further studies aimed at understanding the biology of the insect vectors, reservoir species, and the clinical impact of T cruzi infection as the basis for future educational and control programs in this region."
Comprehensive Survey of Domiciliary Triatomine Species Capable of Transmitting Chagas Disease in Southern Ecuador,"Background Chagas disease is endemic to the southern Andean region of Ecuador, an area with one of the highest poverty rates in the country. However, few studies have looked into the epidemiology, vectors and transmission risks in this region. In this study we describe the triatomine household infestation in Loja province, determine the rate of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in triatomines and study the risk factors associated with infestation. Methodology/Principal Findings An entomological survey found four triatomine species (Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, Triatoma carrioni, Panstrongylus chinai, and P. rufotuberculatus) infesting domiciles in 68% of the 92 rural communities examined. Nine percent of domiciles were infested, and nymphs were observed in 80% of the infested domiciles. Triatomines were found in all ecological regions below 2,200 masl. We found R. ecuadoriensis (275 to 1948 masl) and T. carrioni (831 to 2242 masl) mostly in bedrooms within the domicile, and they were abundant in chicken coops near the domicile. Established colonies of P. chinai (175 to 2003 masl) and P. rufotuberculatus (404 to 1613 masl) also were found in the domicile. Triatomine infestation was associated with surrogate poverty indicators, such as poor sanitary infrastructure (lack of latrine/toilet [w = 0.95], sewage to environment [w = 1.0]). Vegetation type was a determinant of infestation [w = 1.0] and vector control program insecticide spraying was a protective factor [w = 1.0]. Of the 754 triatomines analyzed, 11% were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and 2% were infected with T. rangeli. Conclusions/Significance To date, only limited vector control efforts have been implemented. Together with recent reports of widespread sylvatic triatomine infestation and frequent post-intervention reinfestation, these results show that an estimated 100,000 people living in rural areas of southern Ecuador are at high risk for T. cruzi infection. Therefore, there is a need for a systematic, sustained, and monitored vector control intervention that is coupled with improvement of socio-economic conditions."
"Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Didelphis marsupialis in Santa Catarina and Arvoredo Islands, southern Brazil","Between 1984 and 1993 the prevalence of the Trypanosoma cruzi infection in opossums (Didelphis marsupialis) was studied in Santa Catarina and Arvoredo Islands, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The association of the triatomine bug Panstrongylus megistus with opossums nests and the infection rate of these triatomines by T, cruzi was also studied. Thirteen different locations were studied in Santa Catarina Island (SCI), in which 137 D. marsupialis were collected. Sixty two opossums were collected at the Arvoredo Island (AI), located 12 miles north from SCI. All captured animals were submitted to parasitological examinations that revealed the presence of T. cruzi in 21.9% of the opossums captured in SCI and 45.2% among opossums captured in the AI. The presence of P. megistus was detected in most of the D. marsupialis nests collected in the SCI, however, in the non-inhabited AI only eight triatomines were collected during the whole study. The presence of T. cruzi-infected D. marsupialis associated with P. megistus in human dwellings in the SCI, and the high infection rate of D. marsupilais by T. cruzi in the absence of a high vector density are discussed."
High prevalence of trypanosome co-infections in freshwater fishes,"One thousand three hundred seventy three fish specimens of eight different species from the vicinity of Kyiv, Ukraine, were examined for the presence of trypanosomes and 921 individuals were found to be infected. The prevalence of infection ranged from 24% in freshwater bream, Abramis brama (Linnaeus), to 100 % in spined loach, Cobitis taenia' Linnaeus. The level of parasitaemia also varied significantly between generally mild infections in pikeperch, Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus), and heavy ones in C. taenia'. In most cases the infections with trypanosomes were asymptomatic. Cases of co-infection with species of Trypanoplasma Laveran et Mesnil, 1901 were documented for five out of eight examined host species. Molecular analysis of the 18S rDNA sequences revealed that four hosts, namely northern pike, Esox lucius Linnaeus, freshwater bream, spined loach and European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, were simultaneously infected with two different trypanosome species. Our findings advocate the view that to avoid the risk posed by mixed infections, subsequent molecular taxonomic studies should be performed on clonal lines derived from laboratory cultures of fish trypanosomes."
SEROLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF WILD ANIMAL RESERVOIRS OF TRYPANOSOMA-BRUCEI GAMBIENSE IN THE NATIONAL-PARK-OF-PENDJARI IN THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN,"In the national park of Pendjari, situated in the North-West of Benin, 91 wild animals, belonging to seven species, were darted. Thick and thin blood smears were examined for trypanosomes and plasma for trypanolytic antibodies against 6 antigenic variants of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Parasites were found in 13.92 % and trypanolytic antibodies in 20.88 % of the samples. A total of 28.57 % of animals were positive by at least one of the two test systems used. Morphologically Trypanosoma congolense, T. vivax and T. brucei were identified. Overall prevalence was 40 % in Adenota kob (n : 50), 13.63 % in Alcelaphus buselaphus (n : 22), 10 % in Hippotragus equinus (n : 10), 33 % in Kobus defassa (n : 3), 0 % in Phacochoerus aethiopicus (n : 3) and in Syncerus caffer (n : 2). The only lion (Panthera leo) examined was serologically positive. The results indicate that the wild animals are reservoirs of animal trypanosomes and suggest that among them Adenota kob and Panthera leo are carriers of T. brucei gambiense, one of the etiological aspects of human trypanosomiasis."
Evaluation of a gp63-PCR Based Assay as a Molecular Diagnosis Tool in Canine Leishmaniasis in Tunisia,"A gp63PCR method was evaluated for the detection and characterization of Leishmania (Leishmania) (L.) parasites in canine lymph node aspirates. This tool was tested and compared to other PCRs based on the amplification of 18S ribosomal genes, a L. infantum specific repetitive sequence and kinetoplastic DNA minicircles, and to classical parasitological (smear examination and/or culture) or serological (IFAT) techniques on a sample of 40 dogs, originating from different L. infantum endemic regions in Tunisia. Sensitivity and specificity of all the PCR assays were evaluated on parasitologically confirmed dogs within this sample (N = 18) and control dogs (N = 45) originating from non-endemic countries in northern Europe and Australia. The gp63 PCR had 83.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity, a performance comparable to the kinetoplast PCR assay and better than the other assays. These assays had comparable results when the gels were southern transferred and hybridized with a radioactive probe. As different infection rates were found according to the technique, concordance of the results was estimated by (kappa) test. Best concordance values were between the gp63PCR and parasitological methods (74.6%, 95% confidence intervals CI: 58.8-95.4%) or serology IFAT technique (47.4%, 95% CI: 23.5-71.3%). However, taken together Gp63 and Rib assays covered most of the samples found positive making of them a good alternative for determination of infection rates. Potential of the gp63PCR-RFLP assay for analysis of parasite genetic diversity within samples was also evaluated using 5 restriction enzymes. RFLP analysis confirmed assignment of the parasites infecting the dogs to L. infantum species and illustrated occurrence of multiple variants in the different endemic foci. Gp63 PCR assay thus constitutes a useful tool in molecular diagnosis of L. infantum infections in dogs in Tunisia."
Detection of IgG antibodies against Trypanosoma vivax in cattle by indirect immunofluorescence test,"Trypanosoma vivax infects a wide range of wild and domestic ungulates, causing important losses for the livestock industry. The aim of the present study was to assess the detection of IgG antibodies against T. vivax in cattle from the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Therefore, we analyzed 2.053 blood serum samples from cattle herds of municipalities in Pernambuco, what was made by Immunofluorescence Assay. The overall seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against T. vivax in cattle was 13.93% (286/2053). The frequencies, by region, varied from 11.90% to 15.99%. Thus, the data obtained allowed to characterize the state of Pernambuco as an area of enzootic instability for T. vivax. The frequency herein reported (i.e., 13.93%) indicates that Pernambuco is an endemic area for T. vivax, this parasite being spread throughout the state."
"Canine visceral leishmaniasis in Sao Jose de Ribamar, Maranhao State, Brazil","Here, we describe the situation of canine visceral leishmaniasis in two villages of Sao Jose de Ribamar in Maranhao State/Brazil, where human cases have been registered. Blood samples of 36 household crossbred dogs from Sergio Tamer village and 43 dogs from Quinta village were collected and the serum used for serological diagnosis. An Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect antibodies against Leishmania. The clinical examination showed that 25% of the canine population of Quinta presented a poor body condition and in 39%, ectoparasites (ticks and fleas) were detected. In both tests, serology revealed that 21% (9 out of 43) of the dogs presented antibodies against Leishmania (55% were asymptomatic and 45% were symptomatic). In the Vila Sergio Tamer, 25% (9 out of 36) of the dogs were seropositive for Leishmania (66.67% were asymptomatic and 33.33% were symptomatic), 33% presented poor body condition, and 22% have ectoparasites. The clinical signs more frequent were skin lesions. The statistical analysis showed that there was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between the seropositivity of the dogs from the two villages. The same was observed when the clinical signs were compared (p > 0.05). Both villages have favorable conditions to maintain the cycle of leishmaniasis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Epidemiological survey of hemoprotozoan parasites in cattle from low-country wet zone in Sri Lanka,"The diseases caused by hemoprotozoan parasites in cattle often result in economic losses. In Sri Lanka, previous studies found that the up-country wet zone, which is located in central Sri Lanka, was characterized by a high rate of Theileria orientalis and a low rate of Theileria annulata compared with the dry zone. In this study, DNA samples were prepared from the blood of 121 cattle in Galle, a coastal district located in low-country wet zone in Sri Lanka, and were PCR-screened for Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, T. annulata, T. orientalis, and Trypanosoma theileri. All the parasite species, except B. bovis, were detected among the surveyed cattle. The animals had a high rate of T. orientalis (100%) and a low rate of T. annulata (1.6%), as in the up-country wet zone. Babesia bigemina and Tr. theileri were detected in 19.0% and 20.6% of the animals, respectively, and their infection rates were higher in the animals reared in extensive management systems (32.8% and 27.9%, respectively) than in those managed in intensive/semi-intensive systems (5.0% and 13.3%, respectively). Genotypic analyses found that the T. orientalis mpsp type 5 was predominant similar to up-country wet zone, and that Tr. theileri consisted of seven cad genotypes, including two new genotypes (IL and IM) and four previously detected genotypes (IA, IB, II, and IK). These findings suggest that the hemoprotozoan infection profiles are largely conserved within the wet zone, despite differences in the geography, cattle breeds, and management practices between the up-country and low country wet zones."
Probability of infection with Trypanosoma cruzi of the vector Triatoma infestans fed on infected humans and dogs in northwest Argentina,"The probability that an uninfected Triatoma infestans would become infected with Trypanosoma cruzi after a single feed on people or dogs seropositive for T. cruzi was estimated in Amama, a rural village in northwest Argentina where transmission had resurged four years earlier. The prevalence of seropositivity for T. cruzi was 34.2% among 225 people tested, and 65.1% among 83 dogs tested. Parasitemia was detected by xenodiagnosis in 29.3% of 41 seropositive persons and in 85.3% of 34 seropositive dogs. Parasitemia decreased with age more sharply in seropositive people than in seropositive dogs. Seropositive humans infected 2.6% (95% confidence interval = 1.6%-3.6%) of 963 third or fourth instar nymphs fed once on them, whereas dogs infected 48.7% (44.7%-52.7%) of 610 nymphs. The probability of bug infection increased significantly with instar and was positively related to molting success. The infectivity to bugs of seropositive dogs was 12 times higher than that of seropositive children, and 100 times higher than that of seropositive adults. The weighted probability of infection of an uninfected bug fed randomly on any dog (0.3082) was about 50 times higher than that of bugs fed on any human (0.0062). Such differences in relative infectivity, combined with the relative host-feeding preference of domiciliary Triatoma infestans for dogs, reinforces the important role of domestic dogs as a risk factor for the domestic transmission of T. cruz."
Domestic dogs and cats as sources of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in rural northwestern Argentina,
Camel trypanosomosis in the Canary islands: assessment of seroprevalence and infection rates using the card agglutination test (CATT/T-evansi) and parasite detection tests,"Trypanosomosis due to Trypanosoma evansi (surra) is a major enzootic disease of the dromedary camel. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to assess seroprevalence and infection rates in the Canary Islands using antibody(-card agglutination test-CATT/T. evansi) and parasite detection tests (micro-Haematocrit Centrifugation technique, Giemsa stained blood smears, microscopic examination of lymph node aspirates and mouse inoculation). PCV was also determined. 745 dromedary camels (483 females and 262 males) were examined. Trypanosomes were detected in seven animals. 36 animals yielded CATT positive results while 709 animals were negative. All parasitologically positive animals were also CATT positive. Results showed a good correlation between CATT positive and low PCV and a higher seroprevalence in older animals. Trypanocidal drugs have not been registered in Spain and, consequently, if vigilance is not exercised the prevalence could be increased in the future. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Occurrence of blood parasites and intensity of infection in Prunella modularis in the montane and subalpine zone in the Slovak Carpathians,"The objective of this study was to obtain primary information on the occurrence of blood parasites and intensity of infection in the Dunnock Prunella modularis in the montane region of Slovakia. Altogether 109 birds were examined during the years 2006-2010. The occurrence of Haemoproteus sp., Leucocytozoon fringillinarum and Trypanosoma sp. was documented. Blood parasite prevalences of 45% by microscopic examination and 55% by PCR diagnostics were found. The prevalence of Leucocytozoon sp. was found to be dependent on host sex with males showing a significantly higher intensity of infection with Leucocytozoon. Adult birds showed significantly higher infection prevalence than subadults. The prevalences of both Leucocytozoon sp. and Haemoproteus sp. were significantly dependent on bird age. The intensity of infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon was positively correlated and higher intensity of infection was confirmed in adult birds then in subadults birds. The prevalence of blood parasites in our samples was significantly higher in comparison to most other studies from different countries of Europe conducted at lower altitudes, indicating that the montane zone is especially favourable for the transmission of Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus species."
"The health status of European silver eels, Anguilla anguilla, in the Dutch River Rhine Watershed and Lake IJsselmeer","The worldwide decline of the eel population is thought to be caused by several factors, among which eel diseases. To investigate diseases of European silver eels Anguilla anguilla in the Netherlands, in Nov-Dec 2004 12 silver eels, and in Aug-Dec 2005 80 eels were caught in downstream parts (rivers) of the River Rhine and in Lake IJsselmeer. The eels were measured and weighed, necrotized, and individually checked for presence of external and internal parasites, bacterial infections and viruses, and blood smears were made for haematology. This is the first multidisciplinary study of the health of Dutch silver eels. In the small (2 x 6 eels) pilot study of 2004 in the River Rhine and Lake IJsselmeer respectively, most eels showed aspecific fin haemorrhages, some had ectoparasites, nearly none had parasites in the intestine, half of the groups had Anguillicola crassus in their swimbladder, only few had Trypanosoma's in their blood, and no primary virus or bacterial infections were found, although one eel from Lake IJsselmeer was positive for anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV-1, former Herpesvirus anguillae, HVA) in the PCR test only. The blood of all 6 and 2/6 of the eels respectively was considered abnormal, and the eels had a proper condition. In 2005, in 50 eels from the River Rhine and 30 from Lake IJsselmeer respectively, again aspecific fin haemorrhages were often seen, some of the eels had ectoparasites and parasites in the intestine, most eels had A crassus in their swimbladder, 32% and 53% had Trypanosoma's in their blood, from 44% and 13% of the eels AngHV-1 was isolated, and 44% and 27% were tested positive by PCR, with a peak in August, 10% of both groups of eels had an internal bacterial infection, mostly due to Aeromonas spp. The blood of about half of the eels was considered abnormal, but the eels had a proper condition. It was concluded, that the silver eels of this study had a proper Fulton condition factor (values 2.00-2.26), with aspecific fin haemorrhages, often were Trypanosoma-, A. crassus- and AngHV-1-infected, dependent on the season, and often showed an abnormal haematology. A. crassus causes injuries and is a chronic stress factor, more than the other parasites, which were mostly found less prevalent. In fact, lymphocytosis was directly related to A. crassus infection. Stress and injuries by A. crassus might induce disease through the presence of virus (AngHV-1), relevant in the health status of the silver eels during their spawning migration if ambient water temperatures would enhance a clinical infection of AngHV-1 disease. Moreover this virus might potentially decrease the survival of the silver eels by itself, because spawning migration to the Sargasso Sea takes wild eels to temperate/tropical areas in which the clinical infection by AngHV-1 is surely enhanced.

Serological and parasitological survey of dourine in the Arsi-Bale highlands of Ethiopia,"This study was conducted from August 2005 to January 2007 to determine prevalence and distribution of dourine in horses and to investigate the occurrence of clinical and carrier cases in donkeys and mules in the Arsi-Bale highlands. Study methodology was based on questionnaire, serological, clinical and parasitological survey. The questionnaire indicated that dourine is a major health problem of equines in the Arsi-Bale highlands. Though dourine is commonly observed throughout the year, it has a seasonal character and occurs mostly during the breeding season from June to late September. Serological screening of 646 horses showed a seroprevalence of 184 (28%), 161 (25%) and 125 (19%) for card agglutination test for trypanosomosis, LATEX and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Risk factors were parity number, previous history of abortion and body condition score. No trypanosomes could be detected by Giemsa staining or by haematocrit centrifugation technique. Ten puppies inoculated with blood samples, genital washes and oedematous fluids remained parasitologically negative. Different characteristic signs of dourine were observed. During the genital stage, mares showed vaginal oedema, discharge and presence of depigmented scars over the external genitalia. In stallions, oedema of the scrotum and prepuce, prepucial and urethral discharge, and ulceration of the genital mucosae mainly of the penile were observed. In both sexes, lameness in one or both legs, partial dragging and stiffness of the hind legs and incoordination were the dominant signs observed as nervous form of the disease."
"Seroepidemiological survey of trypanozoon infection in horses in the suspected dourine-infected Bale highlands of the Oromia region, Ethiopia","This paper presents the results of a seroepidemiological survey of trypanozoon infection in horses carried out between September 2007 and June 2008. The survey was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of anti-trypanozoon antibodies in 880 serum samples collected randomly from selected horse-breeding districts of the Bale highlands of Ethiopia. The seroprevalence of trypanozoon infection was found to be 173 (19.66%) and 140 (15.91%) for the CATT/T.evansi and LATEX/T.evansi tests, respectively. The high seroprevalence of trypanozoon infection strongly indicates that the infection is endemic. Neither test can differentiate between anti-trypanozoon antibodies caused by infection with I equiperdum (the causative agent of dourine) and those of T.evansi (the causative agent of surra). The findings of the present study suggest that field-applicable screening serological tests such as the CATT/T.evansi and LATEX/T.evansi could be useful for epidemiological studies and the control of trypanozoon infection."
"Occurrence of haemoparasites in cattle in Monduli district, northern Tanzania","Haemoparasite infections are among the most economically important cattle diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. The present study investigated the occurrence of haemoparasites in 295 indigenous cattle from five villages (Mswakini, Lake Manyara, Naitolia, Makuyuni and Nanja) of the Monduli district, a wildlife-domestic animal-human interface area in northern Tanzania. The data showed that the overall occurrence of haemoparasites in the sampled cattle was 12.5% (95% CI: 8.7% - 16.3%), involving single and mixed infections with Theileria parva, Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bovis, Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma brucei. The highest haemoparasite occurrence was recorded in Lake Manyara (18.3%; 95% CI: 8.5% - 28.1%), and the lowest was recorded in Nanja (6.5%; 95% CI: 0.4% - 12.6%). This preliminary study, furthermore, provided evidence of the possible arthropod vectors (ticks and tsetse flies) that may be involved in the transmission of haemoparasites to cattle in the Monduli district. It is envisaged that this survey will stimulate more studies to determine the prevalence of haemoparasites in livestock by using more sensitive molecular techniques."
"Determination of the prevalence of trypanosome species in cattle from Monduli district, northern Tanzania, by loop mediated isothermal amplification","Bovine African trypanosomosis (BAT) remains one of the major vector-borne diseases with serious impediment to cattle production and economic advancement in sub-Saharan Africa. The present study evaluated the performance of the trypanosome-species-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), using parasite DNA obtained from 295 indigenous Tanzanian short horn Zebu (TSHZ) and Boran crosses in Monduli district within northern Tanzania, against routine microscopy on Giemsa-stained blood films. Compared to parasitological data in which the prevalence of BAT was estimated at 2.4 % (95 % CI 0.7-4.1 %), LAMP increased the prevalence to 27.8 % (95 % CI 22.3-32.5 %), of which 11.9 % (95 % CI 8.2-15.6 %) were monolytic infections with Trypanosoma vivax, while 13.6 % (95 % CI 9.7-17.5 %) were coinfections of either T. vivax and Trypanosoma brucei subspecies or T. vivax and Trypanosoma congolense, respectively. Among the T. brucei subspecies detected, 0.7 % (95 % CI 0-1.7 %) were human-infective Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Our study is in concordance with previous reports and suggests that LAMP is a potential tool for routine diagnosis of trypanosomes in domestic animals in BAT endemic regions. According to LAMP, T. vivax seems to be the predominant trypanosome species circulating among the indigenous Monduli cattle. Importantly, the detection of T. b. rhodesiense in cattle in such wildlife-domestic-animal-human-interface areas poses a risk of contracting human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) by local communities and tourists. Continuous trypanosome surveillances in domestic animals, humans, and tsetse flies using sensitive and specific tests such as LAMP are recommended."
"Trypanosoma cruzi prevalence and epidemiologic trends in lemurs on St. Catherines Island, Georgia","Lemurs on St. Catherines Island, Georgia were tested for Trypanosoma cruzi infection to develop a better understanding of the epizootiology of the parasite in nonhuman primates in the southeastern United States. Fifty-six ring-tailed (Lemur catta), blue-eyed black (Eulemar macaco flavifrons), and black-and-white ruffed (Varecia variegata variegata) lemurs were tested by hemoculture and serology to determine the prevalence of T. cruzi in the population. Of those tested 3 (5%) were identified as culture positive and 25 (44.6%) as seropositive. When hemoculture results were compared with those from a similar study performed in 1997, prevalence remained unchanged. Genetic characterization of the 3 culture isolates indicated they belong to the T. cruzi IIa group, which is identical to strains previously isolated from raccoons on the island. Despite the occurrence of T. cruzi in the population, there was no evidence that the health of the lemurs was compromised as a result of infection. Based upon prevalence and available breeding records we speculate that both vertical and vector-mediated transmission play significant roles in the epidemiology of T. cruzi on the island. This also represents the first report of autochthonous infection in blue-eyed black and black-and-white ruffed lemurs."
Wild Gorillas as a Potential Reservoir of Leishmania major,"Vector-borne parasites of the genus Leishmania are responsible for severe human diseases. Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a common form of the disease, is most often caused by the transmission of Leishmania major to humans by female phlebotomine sand flies. Apes are increasingly being seen as a source of zoonotic diseases, including malaria and rickettsiosis. To examine whether gorillas harbor Leishmania species, we screened fecal samples from wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Cameroon for the presence of these pathogens. Of 91 wild gorilla fecal samples, 12 contained Leishmania parasites, and 4 contained phlebotomine sand fly vectors. The molecular identity was determined by running 3 different polymerase chain reaction tests for detection of L. major. Next, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to visualize L. major parasites in fecal samples from the gorillas. Both promastigote and amastigote forms of the parasite were found. This work strongly suggests that wild gorillas carry pathogenic Leishmania parasites."
"Serological and molecular survey of Leishmania parasites in apparently healthy dogs in the West Bank, Palestine","Background: Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is caused by Leishmania infantum in all Mediterranean countries. The Leishmania parasite is transmitted by the bite of a corresponding sand fly vector and primarily maintained in nature by wild and domestic reservoirs, including dogs, foxes and jackals. Infected dogs are the primary reservoir host in endemic regions and are the most significant risk disposing humans to infection. The present study aimed at assessing the prevalence of infection with Leishmania and identification of Leishmania infantum in domestic dogs in the West Bank, Palestine. Methods: The infection rate among domestic dogs collected from seven districts in the Palestinian West Bank was investigated by examination of parasites in culture from the buffy coat using serological and molecular methods; based on ELISA, internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and cysteine protease (CPB) PCR. Results: Out of 215 dogs examined for Leishmania, 36 (16.7%) were positive in at least one method. Twenty three animals (11.5%) were positive for Leishmania DNA, whereas, ELISA and culture revealed 16 (7.5%), and 4 (1.5%) respectively. CPB-PCR on one of three culture-positive isolates revealed Leishmania infantum as the causative agent for Leishmania infection in dogs. Conclusions: Our study showed that canine leishmania infection is prevalent with varying degrees in all the seven studied districts in Palestine despite the absence of human VL cases in 4 of these districts. The causative agent was confirmed to be Leishmania infantum."
Canine vector-borne disease in travelled dogs in Germany-A retrospective evaluation of laboratory data from the years 2004-2008,"When importing dogs from various Mediterranean countries into Western Europe canine vector-borne infections are often considered as a major issue. Several diseases including babesiosis, leishmaniosis, hepatozoonosis, canine heartworm disease or ehrlichiosis can potentially be endemic in this region and pose a potential health risk for travelling dogs. Information on such infections in travelled dogs is scarce and therefore this study has been undertaken to examine the frequency of vector-borne infections in travelled dogs from the years 2004-2008. A total of 997 samples were screened by direct and/or indirect methods. Total seroprevalence was 7.5% with individual seroprevalence for the 3 species Leishmania spp., Ehrlichia canis and Babesia canis spp. ranging from 3.1 to 4.9%. Total detection rate for pathogens by direct methods was 3.5%. Ninteen Giemsa-stained blood smears were positive for large Babesia. None of the samples screened for microfilariae by Knott's test or for Dirofilaria immitis antigen by DiroChek (R) were positive. Using PCR methods Leishmania-DNA was detected in 1/42 samples but none of 59 animals screened for E. canis-DNA was positive. The prevalence values as established by indirect and direct pathogen detection are considered as rather low. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V."
Parasites and vector-borne pathogens in client-owned dogs in Albania. Blood pathogens and seroprevalences of parasitic and other infectious agents,"Knowledge on the epidemiology of parasitic and vector-borne infections is still very limited for Albania, a country located in the Balkan Peninsula in southeast Europe. Recent publications indicated prevalence rates of up to 52 % for vector-borne infections in less-cared dogs in Albania. To provide data on the epidemiological situation in dogs under veterinary care, a total of 602 client-owned dogs presented to four small animal clinics between March 2010 and April 2011 in Tirana, Albania, were screened by examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears, PCR, and serological methods for the presence of arthropod-borne infections, as well as Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii. Eight different pathogens, namely Babesia vogeli, Hepatozoon canis, Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia canis, and Mycoplasma haemocanis, were detected by direct methods with prevalence rates ranging from 1 to 9 %. Seroprevalence for Babesia spp., L. infantum, Anaplasma spp., and E. canis were 6.6, 5.1, 24.1, and 20.8 %, respectively. Dogs >1 year of age were positive for vector-borne infections significantly more often than younger dogs (p=0.003). More than half (51.7 %) of the dogs were seroreactive to T. gondii and 18.3 % to N. caninum. This is the first report on the detection of A. phagocytophilum, A. platys, E. canis, and M. haemocanis by PCR as well as the serological confirmation of exposure of dogs to N. caninum and T. gondii in Albania. The spectrum of pathogens and the seroprevalences for N. caninum and T. gondii in client-owned dogs from Tirana, Albania, are comparable to that reported in other countries in the Mediterranean Basin. The prevalence rates of vector-borne pathogens are at the lower range of that reported in studies from this geographical region. This is probably due to increased awareness of the owners of pet dogs, including better husbandry conditions and ectoparasiticidal treatment, thus limiting exposure of dogs to vectors."
"Evaluating the impact of targeting livestock for the prevention of human and animal trypanosomiasis, at village level, in districts newly affected with T-b. rhodesiense in Uganda","Background: Uganda has suffered from a series of epidemics of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), a tsetse transmitted disease, also known as sleeping sickness. The area affected by acute Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense HAT (rHAT) has been expanding, driven by importation of infected cattle into regions previously free of the disease. These regions are also affected by African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) demanding a strategy for integrated disease control. Methods: In 2008, the Public Private Partnership, Stamp Out Sleeping Sickness (SOS) administered a single dose of trypanocide to 31 486 head of cattle in 29 parishes in Dokolo and Kaberamaido districts. This study examines the impact of this intervention on the prevalence of rHAT and AAT trypanosomes in cattle from villages that had (HAT(+ve)) or had not (HAT(-ve)) experienced a recent case of rHAT. Cattle herds from 20 villages were sampled and screened by PCR, pre-intervention and 6-months post-intervention, for the presence or absence of: Trypanosoma brucei s.l.; human infective T. b. rhodesiense; Trypanosoma vivax; and Trypanosoma congolense savannah. Results: Post-intervention, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of T. brucei s. l. and the human infective sub-species T. b. rhodesiense in village cattle across all 20 villages. The prevalence of T. b. rhodesiense was reduced from 2.4% to 0.74% (P < 0.0001), with the intervention showing greater impact in HAT-ve villages. The number of villages containing cattle harbouring human infective parasites decreased from 15/20 to 8/20, with T. b. rhodesiense infection mainly persisting within cattle in HAT(+v)e villages (six/eight). The proportion of T. brucei s. l. infections identified as human infective T. b. rhodesiense decreased after the intervention from 8.3% (95% CI=11.1-5.9%) to 4.1% (95% CI= 6. 8-2.3%). Villages that had experienced a recent human case (HAT(+v)e villages) showed a significantly higher prevalence for AAT both pre-and post-intervention. For AAT the prevalence of T. vivax was significantly reduced from 5.9% to 0. 05% post-intervention while the prevalence of T. congolense increased from 8.0% to 12.2%. Conclusions: The intervention resulted in a significant decrease in the prevalence of T. brucei s.l., human infective T. b. rhodesiense and T. vivax infection in village cattle herds. The proportion of T. brucei s. l. that were human infective, decreased from 1: 12 T. brucei s. l. infections before the intervention to 1: 33 post-intervention. It is clearly more difficult to eliminate T. b. rhodesiense from cattle in villages that have experienced a human case. Evidence of elevated levels of AAT in livestock within village herds is a useful indicator of risk for rHAT in Uganda. Integrated veterinary and medical surveillance is key to successful control of zoonotic rHAT."
Domestic pigs as potential reservoirs of human and animal trypanosomiasis in Northern Tanzania,"Background: Pig keeping is becoming increasingly common across sub-Saharan Africa. Domestic pigs from the Arusha region of northern Tanzania were screened for trypanosomes using PCR-based methods to examine the role of pigs as a reservoir of human and animal trypanosomiasis. Methods: A total of 168 blood samples were obtained from domestic pigs opportunistically sampled across four districts in Tanzania (Babati, Mbulu, Arumeru and Dodoma) during December 2004. A suite of PCR-based methods was used to identify the species and sub-species of trypanosomes including: Internally Transcribed Sequence to identify multiple species; species specific PCR to identify T. brucei s. l. and T. godfreyi and a multiplex PCR reaction to distinguish T. b. rhodesiense from T. brucei s. l. Results: Of the 168 domestic pigs screened for animal and human infective trypanosome DNA, 28 (16.7%) were infected with one or more species of trypanosome; these included: six pigs infected with Trypanosoma vivax (3.6%); three with Trypanosoma simiae (1.8%); two with Trypanosoma congolense (Forest) (1%) and four with Trypanosoma godfreyi (2.4%). Nineteen pigs were infected with Trypanosoma brucei s. l. (10.1%) of which eight were identified as carrying the human infective sub-species Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (4.8%). Conclusion: These results show that in Tanzania domestic pigs may act as a significant reservoir for animal trypanosomiasis including the cattle pathogens T. vivax and T. congolense, the pig pathogen T. simiae, and provide a significant reservoir for T. b. rhodesiense, the causative agent of acute Rhodesian sleeping sickness."
Prevalence of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi in raccoons (Procyon lotor) from an urban area of northern Virginia,"Raccoons (Procvon lotor) are reservoir hosts for Trypanosoma cruzi. A 3-yr-long serological survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of antibodies to this zoonotic parasite in raccoons collected from Fairfax County. Virginia, a suburban/urban area outside Washington, D.C. Serum samples from 464 raccoons were examined for T. cruzi antibodies at a 1:40 dilution with an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and Brazil strain T. cruzi amastigotes and trypomastigotes as antigen. A positive IFAT test was found in 154 (33%) of the 464 samples. The yearly prevalence was 49 of 132 (37%) in 2000; 19 of 120 (16%) in 2001; and 86 of 212 (41%) in 2002. Our study indicates that raccoons in this area of Virginia are frequently exposed to T cruzi."
Blood parasites in northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) with an emphasis to Leucocytozoon toddi,"Haemosporidians and trypanosomes of the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) population in the Czech Republic were studied by morphological and molecular methods. Despite the wide distribution of these medium-large birds of prey, virtually nothing is known about their blood parasites. During a 5-year period, altogether 88 nestlings and 15 adults were screened for haemosporidians and trypanosomes by microscopic examination of blood smears and by nested PCR. Both methods revealed consistently higher prevalence of blood protists in adults, Leucocytozoon (80.0 % in adults vs. 13.6 % in nestlings), Haemoproteus (60.0 vs. 2.3 %), Plasmodium (6.7 vs. 0 %), and Trypanosoma (60.0 vs. 2.3 %). Altogether, five haemosporidian lineages were detected by cytochrome b sequencing. Two broadly distributed and host nonspecific lineages, Plasmodium (TURDUS1) and Leucocytozoon (BT2), were detected only sporadically, while three newly described northern goshawk host-specific Leucocytozoon lineages (ACGE01-03) represent the absolute majority of the haemosporidians identified by molecular methods. Our findings support evidences that in falconiform birds the Leucocytozoon toddi group is formed by several hostspecific clusters, with Leucocytozoon buteonis in buzzards and Leucocytozoon mathisi in hawks. Between-year comparisons revealed that the infection status of adults remained predominantly unchanged and individuals stayed uninfected or possessed the same parasite lineages; however, two gains and one loss of blood parasite taxa were also recorded."
Role of the domestic dog as a reservoir host of Leishmania donovani in eastern Sudan,"Background: The study aims to determine the role of domestic dogs in transmission of visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Sudan. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 10 villages along the River Rahad in eastern Sudan to elucidate the role of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris, Linnaeus, 1758) as a reservoir host of Leishmania donovani. In this study, 87 dogs were screened for infection by Leishmania donovani. Blood and lymph node samples were taken from 87 and 33 dogs respectively and subsequently screened by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) test. Additional lymph node smears were processed for microscopy and parasite culture. Host preference of the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) vector in the area, Phlebotomus orientalis, and other sandflies for the Nile rat (Arvicanthis niloticus, E. Geoffrey, 1803), the genet (Genetta genetta, Linnaeus, 1758), the mongoose (Herpeistes ichneumon, Linnaeus, 1758), and the domestic dog were determined by counting numbers of sand flies attracted to CDC traps that were baited by these animals. Results: DAT on blood samples detected anti-Leishmania antibodies in 6 samples (6.9%). Two out of 87 (2.3%) blood samples tested were PCR positive, giving an amplification product of 560 bp. The two positive samples by PCR were also positive by DAT. However, none of the 33 lymph nodes aspirates were Leishmania positive when screened by microscopy, culture and genus-specific PCR. The dog-baited trap significantly attracted the highest number of P. orientalis and sand fly species (P < 0.001). This was followed by the Egyptian mongoose baited trap and less frequently by the genet baited trap. Conclusion: It is concluded that the results obtained from host attraction studies indicate that dog is more attractive for P. orientalis than Egyptian mongoose, common genet and Nile rat."
"Untangling the transmission dynamics of primary and secondary vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in Colombia: parasite infection, feeding sources and discrete typing units","Background: Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease. Due to its genetic diversity has been classified into six Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in association with transmission cycles. In Colombia, natural T. cruzi infection has been detected in 15 triatomine species. There is scarce information regarding the infection rates, DTUs and feeding preferences of secondary vectors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine T. cruzi infection rates, parasite DTU, ecotopes, insect stages, geographical location and bug feeding preferences across six different triatomine species. Methods: A total of 245 insects were collected in seven departments of Colombia. We conducted molecular detection and genotyping of T. cruzi with subsequent identification of food sources. The frequency of infection, DTUs, TcI genotypes and feeding sources were plotted across the six species studied. A logistic regression model risk was estimated with insects positive for T. cruzi according to demographic and eco-epidemiological characteristics. Results: We collected 85 specimens of Panstrongylus geniculatus, 77 Rhodnius prolixus, 37 R. pallescens, 34 Triatoma maculata, 8 R. pictipes and 4 T. dimidiata. The overall T. cruzi infection rate was 61.2% and presented statistical associations with the departments Meta (OR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.69-4.17) and Guajira (OR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.16-3.94); peridomestic ecotope (OR: 2.52: 95% CI: 1.62-3.93); the vector species P. geniculatus (OR: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.51-3.82) and T. maculata (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.02-4.29); females (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.39-3.04) and feeding on opossum (OR: 3. 15; 95% CI: 1.85-11.69) and human blood (OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.07-2.24). Regarding the DTUs, we observed TcI (67. 3%), TcII (6.7%), TcIII (8.7%), TcIV (4.0%) and TcV (6.0%). Across the samples typed as TcI, we detected TcIDom (19%) and sylvatic TcI (75%). The frequencies of feeding sources were 59.4% (human blood); 11.2% (hen); 9.6% (bat); 5.6% (opossum); 5.1% (mouse); 4.1% (dog); 3.0% (rodent); 1.0% (armadillo); and 1.0% (cow). Conclusions: New scenarios of T. cruzi transmission caused by secondary and sylvatic vectors are considered. The findings of sylvatic DTUs from bugs collected in domestic and peridomestic ecotopes confirms the emerging transmission scenarios in Colombia."
"Genotype diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in small rodents and Triatoma sanguisuga from a rural area in New Orleans, Louisiana","Background: Chagas disease is an anthropozoonosis caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that represents a major public health problem in Latin America. Although the United States is defined as non-endemic for Chagas disease due to the rarity of human cases, the presence of T. cruzi has now been amply demonstrated as enzootic in different regions of the south of the country from Georgia to California. In southeastern Louisiana, a high T. cruzi infection rate has been demonstrated in Triatoma sanguisuga, the local vector in this area. However, little is known about the role of small mammals in the wild and peridomestic transmission cycles. Methods: This study focused on the molecular identification and genotyping of T. cruzi in both small rodents and T. sanguisuga from a rural area of New Orleans, Louisiana. DNA extractions were prepared from rodent heart, liver, spleen and skeletal muscle tissues and from cultures established from vector feces. T. cruzi infection was determined by standard PCR using primers specific for the minicircle variable region of the kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) and the highly repetitive genomic satellite DNA (satDNA). Genotyping of discrete typing units (DTUs) was performed by amplification of mini-exon and 18S and 24Sa rRNA genes and subsequent sequence analysis. Results: The DTUs TcI, TcIV and, for the first time, TcII, were identified in tissues of mice and rats naturally infected with T. cruzi captured in an area of New Orleans, close to the house where the first human case of Chagas disease was reported in Louisiana. The T. cruzi infection rate in 59 captured rodents was 76%. The frequencies of the detected DTUs in such mammals were TcI 82%, TcII 22% and TcIV 9%; 13% of all infections contained more than one DTU. Conclusions: Our results indicate a probable presence of a considerably greater diversity in T. cruzi DTUs circulating in the southeastern United States than previously reported. Understanding T. cruzi transmission dynamics in sylvatic and peridomestic cycles in mammals and insect vectors will be crucial to estimating the risk of local, vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi to humans in the United States."
"Trypanosoma evansi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris): prevalence, effect and sexual selection","Parasites play a crucial role in the ecology of animals. They also appear to be important in mechanisms underlying sexual selection processes. In this article we study the prevalence, effect and potential role in sexual selection of the protozoon Typanosoma evansi in capybaras, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris. We collected our samples from the annual capybara cull of a ranch in Venezuela, using the volume of the snout scent gland as an indicator of dominance; the residuals of body weight as indicators of condition; and the residuals of the spleen mass as indicators of immune function. Overall prevalence was 30.9 % (IV= 97) with no difference between males and females, and no relation between infection with T evansi and condition. However, we found that infected animals had larger spleens (residuals), indicating an immunological cost of the infection. Furthermore, males with larger snout scent glands (more dominant) were less likely to be infected than males with smaller glands (less dominant), suggesting that by choosing males with a large glands, females may be using the gland as an indicator of health, which is consistent with the,""good genes"" view of sexual selection."
"Trypanosoma cruzi infection in wild mammals of the National Park 'Serra da Capivara' and its surroundings (Piaui, Brazil), an area endemic for Chagas disease","We studied the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection among eight species of wild small mammals (n = 289) in an area where human cases of infection/disease have occurred. Dogs (n = 52) and goats (n = 56) were also surveyed. The study was carried out inside a biological reserve, the National Park 'Serra da Capivara' and its surroundings in Piaui State, Brazil. The marsupial Didelphis albiventris and the caviomorph rodent Trichomys apereoides were found to be the most important reservoirs in the study area. Trichomys apereoides was the most abundant species (80%) and D. albiventris the most frequently infected (61%). Both T cruzi I and T cruzi II genotypes were isolated from these species. One specimen of Tr. apereoides displayed a mixed T cruzi I/zymodeme 3 infection. Serum prevalence among dogs suggests that they may be involved in the maintenance of the parasite in the peridomestic environment, in contrast to goats, which are not apparently of any epidemiological importance. The distinct distribution and patterns of infection observed in the study areas suggest that even in the same biome, epidemiological studies or determination of control measures must take into account ecological peculiarities.

"FREQUENCY OF HEMOPARASITES OF BOVINES FROM CAUCA AND SAN JORGE RIVERS, 2000-2005","Objective. To determine the frequency of hemoparasites in bovines evaluated by direct microscopy. Materials and methods. A descriptive retrospective cross study was carried out. All the data of the last 5 years from the Lavebac laboratory was analyzed. This laboratory offers its services in the Cauca-Medio Antioqueno and the Department of Cordoba. A frequency analysis was conducted, taking into consideration the type of parasite, the type of cattle operation, origin and season. Comparative analyses using odds ratios were conducted using EPIINFO, version 3.3. Results. The frequency of hemoparasitism was 22.5%. Of these 59.3% of parasites were Anaplasma sp, 3.1% were Babesia sp and 30.9% were Trypanosoma sp. The positive diagnostics occurred more frequently in the dry season (14.9%) in which a higher frequency of infection by Anaplasma sp. was detected. Conclusions. These results allow an approximation to the frequency and distribution of Trypanosoma sp, Babesia sp and Anaplasma sp in two cattle raising regions of Colombia. A higher percentage of hemoparasite infection was found during the dry season, and Anaplasma sp was the most frequent of parasite."
Canine tegumentar leishmaniasis in the town of Balneario Camboriu in the State of Santa Catarina,"Introduction: The increase in American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) cases in 2005 was due to an outbreak that occurred in the towns of Itapema and Balneario Camboriu. This study aimed to determine the possible presence of infection by Leishmania sp in domestic dogs living in an endemic focus of ATL in the town of Balneario Camboriu and verify the existence of a correlation between the humoral and cellular immune responses, the presence of suggestive lesions and positivity in direct parasitological exams. Methods: A total of 275 dogs were evaluated, examined according to clinic aspects, the development of delayed hypersensitivity to Immunoleish (R) antigens and serological responses to the indirect immunofluorescence reaction and immunoenzymatic assay. Results: Seven dogs presented suspect lesions, but Leishmania was not detected using the direct parasitological method. The serological result was 5.8% positivity using the IIFR technique, 6.2% by ELISA and 1.8% using the intradermal test. The total number of dogs positive for ATL using the serological exams and/or intradermal test was 24, indicating prevalence of 8.7% for ATL. Conclusions: Further studies are required to evaluate the participation of dogs in the epidemiological chain of ATL in Balneario Camboriu."
"Occurence of the travel diseases leishmaniasis, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis and dirofiloriosis in dogs living in Germany","This article gives a review of the occurence and relevance of Leishmania spp., Ehrlichia canis, Babesia spp. and Dirofilaria immitis in dogs in Germany with a history of traveling. The collective of this retrospective study included blood samples from 5483 dogs from all over Germany, which were sent to the Vet Med Labor GmbH in Ludwigsburg during the years 2005 and 2006 with a ""travel disease profile"" Antibodies against Leishmania spp. and Ehrlichia canis were detected using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFAT). Babesia spp. DNA was detected by means of PCR and Dirofilaria immitis antigen by means of ELISA. The percentage of positive antibody titers against Ehrlichia canis was relatively constant, with values of 12.5 % (2005) and 14.5 % (2006). Positive antibody titers against Leishmania sop. were slightly higher with an average of 17.7 %. Babesia spp. DNA and Dirofilaria immitis antigen were detected in less than 2.7 % and 1.2 % of the dog blood samples, respectively. Dual infections were seen in 4.2 % of the samples with mostly Leishmania-Ehrlichia co-infections, followed by simultaneous infections with Leishmania sop. and Babesia spp. Triple infections were rare (< 0.2 % of all samples). Due to the increased importation of dogs from foreign countries and the traveling of owners and dogs within the European Community, as well as the already known endemic status of formerly purely imported diseases, the diagnostics, therapy and prophylaxis of imported parasite infections and diseases caused by hemotropic bacteria, protozoa, and filaria have become more important in Germany, Accordingly, veterinarians should be able to recognize and diagnose these diseases using the suitable tests in order to treat them appropriately."
"Trypanosome species, including Trypanosoma cruzi, in sylvatic and peridomestic bats of Texas, USA","In contrast to other mammalian reservoirs, many bat species migrate long-distances and have the potential to introduce exotic pathogens to new areas. Bats have long been associated with blood-borne protozoal trypanosomes of the Schizotrypanum subgenus, which includes the zoonotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, agent of Chagas disease. Another member of the subgenus, Trypanosoma dionisii, infects bats of Europe and South America, and genetic similarities between strains from the two continents suggest transcontinental movement of this parasite via bats. Despite the known presence of diverse trypanosomes in bats of Central and South America, and the presence of T. cruzi-infected vectors and wildlife in the US, the role of bats in maintaining and dispersing trypanosomes in the US has not yet been reported. We collected hearts and blood from 8 species of insectivorous bats from 30 counties across Texas. Using PCR and DNA sequencing, we tested 593 bats for trypanosomes and found 1 bat positive for T. cruzi (0.17%), 9 for T. dionisii (1.5%), and 5 for Blastocrithidia spp. (0.8%), a group of insect trypanosomes. The T. cruzi-infected bat was carrying TcI, the strain type associated with human disease in the US. In the T. dionisii-infected bats, we detected three unique variants associated with the three infected bat species. These findings represent the first report of T. cruzi in a bat in the US, of T. dionisii in North America, and of Blastocrithidia spp. in mammals, and underscore the importance of bats in the maintenance of trypanosomes, including agents of human and animal disease, across broad geographic locales.

"Repeated cross-sectional study of Trypanosoma cruzi in shelter dogs in Texas, in the context of Dirofilaria immitis and tick-borne pathogen prevalence","Background Vector-borne diseases have an adverse impact on health of dogs, and infected dogs can be sentinels for human infection. Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, an agent of Chagas disease, causes fatal heart disease in dogs across the southern United States but has been neglected from wide-scale prevalence studies. Objectives To determine the prevalence of exposure to T. cruzi, Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, and infection with Dirofilaria immitis among dogs in shelters across Texas and to identify risk factors for T. cruzi seropositivity. Animals Six hundred and eight dogs. Methods This repeated cross-sectional study was performed by collecting blood from similar to 30 dogs during each of the 3 visits to 7 shelters. We tested serum for antibodies to T. cruzi using 2 tests in series and for antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., and B. burgdorferi and D. immitis antigen using the IDEXX SNAP 4DX Plus point-of-care test. DNA was extracted from blood clots and tested for T. cruzi DNA and strain type via quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR). We used logistic regression to assess risk factors. Results One hundred ten (18.1%) of 608 dogs were seropositive for T. cruzi. Prevalence of exposure to the other vector-borne agents was: Ehrlichia spp. 3.6%; Anaplasma spp. 6.9%; B. burgdorferi 0.2%; and D. immitis infection 16.0%. Six of 559 (1.1%) dogs were qPCR-positive for T. cruzi. Conclusions and Clinical Importance T. cruzi seroprevalence was comparable to D. immitis prevalence and higher than seroprevalence of the tick-borne pathogens. T. cruzi is an underrecognized health threat to dogs across Texas and possibly other southern states where triatomine vectors are endemic."
"Occurrence and diversity of arthropod-transmitted pathogens in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in western Austria, and possible vertical (transplacental) transmission of Hepatozoon canis","Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the most abundant wild canid species in Austria, and it is a well-known carrier of many pathogens of medical and veterinary concern. The main aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence and diversity of protozoan, bacterial and filarial parasites transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods in a red fox population in western Austria. Blood (n = 351) and spleen (n = 506) samples from foxes were examined by PCR and sequencing and the following pathogens were identified: Babesia canis, Babesia cf. microti (syn. Theileria annae), Hepatozoon canis, Anaplasma phagocy-tophilum, Candidatus Neoehrlichia sp. and Bartonella rochalimae. Blood was shown to be more suitable for detection of Babesia cf. microti, whilst the spleen tissue was better for detection of H. canis than blood. Moreover, extremely low genetic variability of H. canis and its relatively low prevalence rate observed in this study may suggest that the parasite has only recently been introduced in the sampled area. Furthermore, the data presented here demonstrates, for the first time, the possible vertical transmission of H. canis from an infected vixen to the offspring, and this could explain the very high prevalence in areas considered free of its main tick vector(s)."
"Vector-borne pathogens affecting shelter dogs in eastern Crete, Greece","Canine pathogens transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods are of significant importance for veterinary and, in some cases, human health. However, they are still underestimated and rarely investigated in many parts of the Mediterranean region, mostly due to financial reasons. Therefore, in the present paper, we investigated the occurrence of blood-associated pathogens affecting dogs in Crete, Greece. For this purpose, blood samples from 103 shelter dogs were screened for the pathogens by PCR and serological tests. Overall, samples from 43 dogs scored positive for at least one pathogen (41.8%). In particular, antibodies to Leishmania infantum were detected in 26 dogs (25.2%), and 15 and 11 animals were positive for Hepatozoon canis (14.6%) and Mycoplasma haemocanis (10.7%) by PCR, respectively. Co-infections were recorded in nine animals. Clinical signs indicative of infection (alterations of skin or coat or reduced body condition) were detected in 10 animals, four of which were infected with one pathogen, three with two pathogens. Based on the results obtained, dogs from Crete appear to be frequently exposed to several blood-borne pathogens, including agents of zoonotic concern. Given that some of the pathogens were reported for the first time in this area, results presented in our study should improve the awareness of the local veterinarians and of dog rescue organisations in order to reduce disease burden on stray and owned dogs and to control the spread of canine vector-borne diseases from Greece to non-endemic areas by travelling or exported infected dogs."
Prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi in water buffaloes in remote areas in Northern Vietnam using PCR and serological methods,
Standard sampling techniques underestimate prevalence of Avian Hematozoa in willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus),"A total of 68 willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus L.) was collected during September 1,995 from two localities in Troms Count),, northern Norway. Thin blood smears were prepared and examined for blood parasites. Of the 68 willow ptarmigan exaniined, 94% harbored one or More species of hematozoa. There were four (6%), 44 (65%), 16 (24%), and four (6%) birds infected by zero, one, two, and three species of parasites, respectively. Prevalences at the coastal locality, Kattfjord (n=43), were Leucocytozoon lovati 86%, Trypanosoma avium, (26%), and microfilariae (30%). At the inland locality, Iselvdalen (n=25), prevalences were L. lovati 96%, T. avium 12%, and microfilariae 0%. We also searched connective tissues for the filaroid nematode Splendidofilaria papillocerca; in Kattfjord this parasite only occurred in adult hosts where prevalence was 94%, but the parasite was not found in Iselvdalen. To estimate the efficiency of parasite (detection by standard blood sampling techniques, we sampled peripheral blood from the bracilial wing Vein and blood from the pulmonary system from willow ptarmigan. Sampling peripheral blood from the brachial vein led to underestimates of the prevalence of microfilariae. There was no significant difference between L. lovati and T. avium. prevalence in blood collected from the brachial vein or deep circulation. Age of host had a strong impact on prevalence, especially for S. papillocerca and microfilariae."
Adaptation and validation of antibody-ELISA using dried blood spots on filter paper for epidemiological surveys of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomosis in cattle,"The indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of anti trypanosomal antibodies in bovine serum was adapted for use with dried blood spots on filter paper. Absorbance (450 nm) results for samples were expressed as percent positivity, i.e. percentage of the median absorbance result of four replicates of the strong positive control serum. The antibody-ELISA was evaluated in Zambia for use in epidemiological surveys of the prevalence of tsetse-transmitted bovine trypanosomosis. Known negative samples (sera, n=209; blood spots, n=466) were obtained from cattle from closed herds in tsetse-free areas close to Lusaka. Known positive samples (sera, n=367; blood spots, n=278) were obtained from cattle in Zambia's Central, Lusaka and Eastern Provinces, diagnosed as being infected with Trypanosoma brucei, ir: congolense, or T. vivax using the phase-contrast buffy-coat technique or Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears. For sera (at a cut-off value of 23.0% positivity) sensitivity and specificity were 86.1 and 95.2%, respectively. For bloodspots (at a cut-off value of 18.8% positivity) sensitivity and specificity were 96.8 and 95.7%, respectively. The implications of persistence of antibodies following treatment or self-cure are discussed. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
Chagas disease in the Bolivian Chaco: Persistent transmission indicated by childhood seroscreening study,
Seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis in asymptomatic dogs in Iran,"Clinically infected dogs have been identified as the main reservoir hosts of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum. Recently asymptomatic infected dogs were regarded to be as important as clinically ill dogs. This study was aimed to determine the seroprevalence of L. infantum infection among asymptomatic dogs in the southwest and central parts of Iran and to investigate possible risk factors associated with this infection. 548 serum samples were collected from dogs in three Iranian provinces and subjected to direct agglutination test (DAT) in dilutions of 1:80 to 1:20480. Fifty three (9.67%) of the dogs had detectable anti-L. infantum antibodies at dilutions of >= 1:80. Living status of the dogs (household or free roaming) was a potential risk factor for the infection; seroprevalence was significantly higher in free roaming dogs (P<0.001). Dogs of more than 2-year-old had a significantly higher infection rate in comparison with younger dogs (P<0.001). No significant statistical differences were seen between seroprevalences of the male and female dogs. The results of this study show relatively high sero-prevalence of L. infantum infection in evaluated regions and higher seroprevalence in old and free roaming dogs, which shows the importance of environmental contamination and access of the dogs to the other reservoir hosts."
"PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES TO TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI, TOXOPLASMA GONDII, ENCEPHALITOZOON CUNICULI, SARCOCYSTIS NEURONA, BESNOITIA DARLINGI, AND NEOSPORA CANINUM IN NORTH AMERICAN OPOSSUMS, DIDELPHIS VIRGINIANA, FROM SOUTHERN LOUISIANA","We examined the prevalence of antibodies to zoonotic protozoan parasites (Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii, and Encephalitozoon cuniculi) and protozoans of veterinary importance (Neospora caninum, Sarcocystis neurona, and Besnoitia darlingi) in a population of North American opossums (Didelphis virginiana) from Louisiana. Samples from 30 opossums were collected as part of a survey for T anal in Louisiana. Frozen sera from these 30 opossums were examined using an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) against in vitro-produced antigenic stages of these protozoans. Additionally, 24 of the 30 samples were examined using hemoculture, and all 30 were examined in the modified direct agglutination test (MAT) for antibodies to To. goodii. The prevalences of reactive IFAT samples were as follows: 60% for T cruzi, 27% for To. gondii, 23% for E. cuniculi, 17% for S. neurona, 47% for B. darlingi, and 0% for N. caninum. Hemoculture revealed that 16 (67%) of 24 samples were positive for T cruzi, compared to 18 of 30 (60%) by IFAT. The sensitivity and specificity for the IFAT compared to hemoculture was 100% for each. The modified direct agglutination test revealed that 9 (30%) of the 30 samples from opossums had antibodies to To. gondii, compared to 8 (27%) using the IFAT. The sensitivity and specificity of the IFAT compared to the MAT was 100% and 72%, respectively."
Prevalence of borreliae in ixodid ticks from a floodplain forest ecosystem,"Host-seeking ixodid ticks were sampled in a floodplain forest ecosystem along the lower reaches of the Thaya (Dyje) river in South Moravia (Czech Republic) and Lower Austria during the period 1989-2002. The ticks were examined by dark-field microscopy for borreliae (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the agent of Lyme borreliosis), and attempts were made to culture the spirochetes in BSK-H medium from preparations containing their high numbers. Isolated borreliae were identified by PCR-RFLP analysis using probes directed against ribosomal spacer genes. A total of 797 nymphal and 719 adult (391 female, 328 male) Ixodes ricinus were examined: 16.2% of nymphs, 28.6% of females and 29.0% of males were positive. Dermacentor reficulatus (70 females, 30 males) and Haemaphysalis concinna 12 nymphs, 8 females, 2 males) were negative for spirochetes. The overall prevalence rate of borreliae in /. ricinus from the floodplain forest is slightly higher than the mean European data (i.e., 14% for nymphs, 21% for adults). The difference in infection rate between nymph and adult ticks was significant, including the proportion of heavily infected (with >100 borreliae) nymphs (2.1%) vs. adults (7.6%). Prevalence of borreliae in /. ricinus showed a significant decrease during autumn in this ecosystem. Three strains of spirochetes, all of the Borrelia afzelii genomic group, were isolated from female /. ricinus. Moreover, Trypanosoma/Crithidia sp. protozoa and Dipetalonema rugosicauda nematodes were detected in 0.4% and 1.0%, respectively, of all /. ricinus."
A report on the molecular detection and seasonal prevalence of Trypanosoma brucei in Dromedary Camels from Dera Ghazi Khan District in Southern Punjab (Pakistan),"The present study was designed for molecular detection of Trypanosoma brucei through PCR, by using kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) maxicircle primers, on seasonal basis and to demonstrate the effect of this parasite on complete blood count and selected parameters of serum biochemistry in camels from Southern Punjab (Pakistan). A total of 291 camel blood samples (61 male, 230 females) were collected from Dera Ghazi Khan District in Pakistan during March 2012 till February 2013 for Trypanosoma brucei detection by blood smear screening, micro hemato centrifugation and Polymerase chain reaction techniques. Twenty eight out of 291 blood samples (9.62%) produced a 164 bp DNA fragment specific for T. brucei. Only 6 blood samples (2.06%) were found parasite positive by microscopic examination and 13 (4.46%) were positive for microhematocrit centrifugation technique. Seasonal PCR based prevalence of trypanosomiasis was 6.9%, 13.7%, 9.7% and 8.1% during spring, summer, autumn and winter seasons respectively. T. brucei prevalence was not restricted to a particular age group or and gender of the studied animals (P > 0.05). A significant increase in WBC (P = 0.001), neutrophils (P = 0.004), ALT (P = 0.028) and decreased RBC (P < 0.000), hemoglobin (P < 0.000) and packed cell volume (P < 0.000) were detected in parasite positive as compared to the parasite negative blood samples. In conclusion, PCR is a more reliable and sensitive technique than conventional microscopic blood screening and microhematocrit centrifugation for the detection of T. brucei in camel blood. We recommend the use of PCR for the effective prophylactic detection of T. brucei in livestock in order to reduce economic losses."
"Molecular Detection and Seasonal Prevalence of Trypanosoma brucei and its Effect on Hematobiochemical Parameters in Donkeys from Dera Ghazi Khan District in Southern Punjab, Pakistan","The present study was designed to report the prevalence of Trypanosome brucei in blood samples of donkeys (n=283) collected from Dera Ghazi Khan District in Punjab (Pakistan) through PCR amplification of their maxicircle kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) during four seasons in 2013 and to demonstrate the effect of this parasite on complete blood count (CBC) and selected parameters of serum. Out of 283 blood samples, 19 (6.71%) generated a 164 bp DNA fragment specific for T. brucei. Only 7 blood samples (2.5%) were found Trypanosome sp. positive through microscopic examination of blood smears while 13 (4.6%) were found positive by microhematocrit centrifugation technique. Parasite prevalence was 4.76% (3/65) in spring, 8.22% (6/73) in summer, 8.45% (6/71) in autumn and 5.41% (4/74) in winter, detected by PCR. Analysis of results revealed no significant association of T. brucei prevalence with age (P > 0.05) and gender (P > 0.05) of animals. Comparison of hematobiochemical profile revealed a significant increase in white blood cell count (P = 0.002), neutrophil count (P < 0.001), neutrophil [%] (P < 0.001) and ALT (P = 0.019) while decrease in red blood cell count (P < 0.001), hemoglobin (P = 0.003), packed cell volume (P = 0.003) lymphocytes (P < 0.001) and lymphocytes [%] (P < 0.001) in T. brucei positive animals as compared to the animals where parasite was not detected in blood through PCR. We concluded that PCR is more reliable and sensitive technique for the detection of T. brucei in blood samples from donkeys than blood smear screening and microhematocrit centrifugation techniques. It is recommended to be used for the detection of this parasite in order to minimize economic losses."
Clinico-hematological and oxidative stress status in Nili Ravi buffaloes infected with Trypanosoma evansi,"Hemoparasitic diseases like trypanosomiasis have an adverse influence on the health and working capability of infected animals. Monitoring and identification of blood born parasitic infections in dairy animals are of vital importance to get the optimum production. In this study blood samples were collected from Nili Ravi buffaloes (n = 390) kept at different villages of district Lodhran, Punjab province of Pakistan. Blood samples were evaluated for red blood cell counts, total and differential leukocyte counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin, total proteins and different serum parameters such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, malondialdehyde, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphorous, copper, calcium and magnesium. Overall prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi was 4.61% based on microscopic smear examination, 11.02% with Formol Gel Test and 16.15% with PCR. Infected buffaloes showed different clinical signs, including high fever (105 +/- 1.0 degrees F), edema of face and legs, hyperemic mucosa of eyes, lachrymation, bulging eyes, pale mucus membranes and frequent urination. Microscopic examination of blood films showed morphologically different parasites. Statistical analysis did not indicate an association of infection based on age and sex of buffaloes. Results revealed significantly (p < 0.05) lower values of red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and total proteins, while increased values of mean corpuscular volume, total white blood cells, monocyte, neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils in infected animals. Infected buffaloes were suffering from macrocytic hypochromic anemia. A significant (p < 0.05) increase in serum lipid per oxidation product (malondialdehyde) level and serum enzymes while a decrease in macrominerals and trace mineral (copper) in trypanosomiasis positive buffaloes were recorded. It was concluded that Trypanosoma evansi is prevalent in Pakistan under tropical and subtropical climatic conditions. It causes clinical disease with macrocytic hypochromic anemia and oxidative stress in infected buffaloes."
THE BLOOD PARASITES OF INDIGENOUS LIVESTOCK IN SAUDI-ARABIA,"The blood parasites of indigenous camels, sheep, goats and cattle were investigated in several localities in Saudi Arabia that are well isolated from any possible mixing with imported animals. The present study is the first detailed investigation on blood parasites infecting indigenous livestock in Saudi Arabia. Trypanosoma evansi and an Eperythrozoon sp. were detected in camels. Sheep and goats were infected with Theileria ovis, Theileria hirci and with Eperythrozoon ovis and cattle with Eperythrozoon wenyoni, Theileria annulata and with a nonpathogenic Theileria sp. Apart from T. evansi and T. annulata, all parasite species are reported for the first time from Saudi Arabia. The detection of an Eperythrozoon sp. form the camel is the first from this host. Theileria ovis and E. ovis were reported from all provinces examined, while T. hirci was confined to eastern and northern parts of the Kingdom. Eperythrozoon wenyoni was found in both of Hofuf and Gizan, but T. annulata occurred in Hofuf only and the nonpathogenic Theileria sp. in Gizan only. Areas of highest camel trypanosomiasis prevalence were heavily infested with tabanid flies whose role in the transmission of the disease was discussed. The pathological effects of the reported blood parasites on their hosts was discussed together with the role of ixodid ticks in the transmission of the Theileria species."
Molecular identification of different trypanosome species and subspecies in tsetse flies of northern Nigeria,"Background: Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is caused by several species of trypanosomes including Trypanosoma congolense, T. vivax, T. godfreyi, T. simiae and T. brucei. Two of the subspecies of T. brucei also cause Human African Trypanosomiasis. Although some of them can be mechanically transmitted by biting flies; these trypanosomes are all transmitted by tsetse flies which are the cyclical vectors of Trypanosoma congolense, T. godfreyi, T. simiae and T. brucei. We present here the first report assessing the prevalence of trypanosomes in tsetse flies in Nigeria using molecular tools. Methods: 488 tsetse flies of three species, Glossina palpalis palpalis, G. tachinoides and G. morsitans submorsitans were collected from Wuya, Niger State and Yankari National Park, Bauchi State in 2012. Trypanosomes were detected and identified using an ITS1 PCR assay on DNA purified from the 'head plus proboscis' (H + P) and abdomen (ABD) parts of each fly. Results: T. vivax and T. congolense Savannah were the major parasites detected. Trypanosomes prevalence was 7.1 % in G. p. palpalis, 11.9 % in G. tachinoides and 13.5 % in G. m. submorsitans. Prevalences of T. congolense Savannah ranged from 2.5 to 6.7 % and of T. vivax were approximately 4.5 %. Trypanosoma congolense Forest, T. godfreyi and T. simiae were also detected in the site of Yankari. The main biological and ecological determinants of trypanosome prevalence were the fly sex, with more trypanosomes found in females than males, and the site, with T. congolense subspp. being more abundant in Yankari than in Wuya. As expected, the trypanosome species diversity was higher in Yankari National Park than in the more agricultural site of Wuya where vertebrate host species diversity is lower. Conclusions: Our results show that T. congolense Savannah and T. vivax are the main species of parasite potentially causing AAT in the two study sites and that Yankari National Park is a potential reservoir of trypanosomes both in terms of parasite abundance and species diversity."
First data on the prevalence and distribution of pathogens in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris and bombus pascuorum) from Spain,
INCOMPETENCE OF ROE DEER AS RESERVOIRS OF THE LYME BORRELIOSIS SPIROCHETE,"To determine whether the roe deer, Capreolus capreolus L. may serve as a reservoir host for the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt & Brenner, evidence of spirochetal infection was sought in nymphal Ixodes ricinus (L.) that had engorged as larvae on roe deer. Sixteen roe deer were shot in Lyme disease enzootic areas of south-central Sweden during August-November 1990 and August 1991. An average of 276 (range, 84-658) larvae of I. ricinus was collected from each of 12 deer shot in August Of those ticks that had fed on deer and then developed to the nymphal stage, the gut contents of 238 were examined by phase-contrast microscopy. All these ticks were negative for spirochetes, whereas 4.2% contained Trypanosoma cf cervi Kingston & Morton and 15.1% contained the nematode Dipetalonema rugosicauda Meszaros & Sugar. A total of 396 nymphal ticks was collected by blanket-dragging during May-June 1991 and examined for spirochetes; 9.1% of these host-seeking nymphs were infected with spirochetes. Although the roe deer serves as a principal blood source for all stages of I. ricinus, it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi."
"Molecular characterization of sandflies and Leishmania detection in main vector of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in Abarkouh district of Yazd province, Iran","Objective: To assess molecular characterization, distribution, seasonal activities of sandfly species and Leishmania parasites infecting them for this zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis focus. Methods: The collections were carried out in 2009-2011 using CDC traps, Sticky Papers and manual aspirator in and around the villages in Abarkouh district. Individual sandflies were characterized by PCR amplification and sequencing of fragments of their mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Leishmania parasite infections within sandflies were performed by targeting Cyt b, ITS-rDNA, k-DNA and microsatellite genes. Results: The PCR assays detected only Leishmania major (L. major). All infections (30) were found in the abundant and widespread vector Phlebotomus papatasi (P. papatasi). Small numbers of other saucily species were also screened for infections, but none was found. Sergentomyia sintoni and P. papatasi were the predominant members in all locations of this district and in all habitats throughout the trapping season. Only five other sandfly species were found, namely Phlebolomus ansari, Phlebotomus caucasicus, Phlebotomus sergenti, Sergentomyia dentata and Sergentomyia merviney. Conclusions: In the current survey, the only infections detected are of L. major in females of P. papatasi (30 out of 190). The rates of infection of P. papatasi by L. major are not significantly different in compare with other locations in Iran with no diversity of parasite strains. Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis may have emerged only recently in Abarkouh district, and the reason may well be the instability of the transmission cycles there."
Parasitological and molecular surveys reveal high rates of infection with vector-borne pathogens and clinical anemia signs associated with infection in cattle from two important livestock areas in Colombia,"In Colombia, vector-borne diseases are one of the most important problems in the livestock industry. The present study reports parasitological and molecular surveys of vector-borne pathogens in cattle from two high-value livestock areas in Colombia. A total of 464 samples (226 from Antioquia and 238 from Arauca) were analyzed. While the blood smear analysis identified 98 (21.1%), 14 (3.0%) and 30 (6.5%) positive samples for Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp. and Trypanosoma spp., respectively, the molecular methods indicated that 275 (59.3%), 146 (31.5%), 64 (13.8%), 236 (50.9%) and 43 (9.3%) of the samples were positive for Anaplasma marginate, Babesia bigemina, Babesia bovis, Trypanosoma theileri and T. evansi, respectively. Mixed infections were detected in 250 (53.9%) samples. Interestingly, animals aged <= 1 year had higher probabilities of being infected with A. marginate and Babesia spp., and lower probabilities of being infected with Trypanosoma spp., while the animals raised under intensive system breeding had higher probabilities of being infected with all pathogens. Additionally, T. theileri infection was found in higher prevalence in anemic animals than animals with normal packed cell volume (PCV). This is the first molecular report that evaluated the infection with three genders of vector-borne pathogens in cattle in Colombia and provides useful information for a better understanding of the epidemiologic aspects, as well as for the management and control, of these diseases.

Spatial-temporal and phylogeographic characterization of Trypanosoma spp. in cattle (Bos taurus) and buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) reveals transmission dynamics of these parasites in Colombia,"Animal Trypanosomiasis (AT) is one of the most important problems in the Colombian livestock industry reducing its production around 30%. Caribbean and Orinoquia regions play a significant role in the development of this industry, having about 6.9 million cattle and 113,000 buffaloes. Considering the paucity in studies to understand the epidemiological features and control of AT in Colombia, the present study reports the seasonal transmission patterns and phylogeographic traits of the causal agents of AT in cattle and buffaloes from these regions. Between 2014 and 2016, a three-point longitudinal survey was designed to evaluate the mentioned characteristics. Molecular analysis in cattle showed an AT prevalence of 39.2% (T theileri 38.6%, T. evansi 6.7% and T. vivax 0.2%), with higher values during wet and late wet seasons, while in buffaloes the prevalence was 28.2% (T. theileri 28.2% and T. evansi 1.3%), with higher values during the dry season. Additionally, variables such as tabanid abundance, vector control, breeding system, age and anemia signs were significantly associated with AT prevalence (P < 0.05). Only T. theileri infection was higher in cattle with anemia signs than those with normal packed cell volume. Finally, phylogeographic analysis revealed that Colombian T. theileri isolates were associated to specific host genotypes IA and IIB, described worldwide; T. vivax isolates were related to the genotype from West Africa; while T evansi isolates are related to the South American genotypes and to new genotypes. This is the first longitudinal survey that evaluates through molecular methods, the infection of Trypanosoma spp. in two important livestock regions from Colombia, showing that the clinical effects and prevalence of these trypanosomes in cattle and buffaloes are modulated by seasonal variations, host factors, and parasite traits. The results suggest that these factors have to be taken into account to successfully control AT in these regions."
Hemoprotozoa of freshwater turtles in Queensland,"Blood smears from 27 turtles (15 Emydura signata, nine Elseya latisternum, and three Chelodina longicollis) from southeastern Queensland (Australia) were examined for infections by hemoprotozoan parasites between January and June 1999. Infections were found in 26 (96%) of the turtles. Twenty five (93%) were infected with the adeleorin coccidian Haemogregarina clelandi, eight (30%) with the hemosporidian Haemoproteus chelodinae, 11 (41%) with the kinetoplastid flagellate Trypanosoma chelodinae, and eight (30%) with a novel Trypanosoma sp. Despite the high prevalence and intensity of infections, there was no evidence of clinical disease in any of the turtles."
Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in the wild and its most important reservoir hosts in Brazil,"Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae) infects all tissues of its hosts, which along with humans, include hundreds of mammalian species in the Americas. The epidemiology of T. cruzi has been changing in that currently the majority of the cases and/or outbreaks of Chagas disease occur by the ingestion of comestibles contaminated by T. cruzi metacyclic forms. These cases/outbreaks occur in distinct regional scenarios, mainly in the Amazon biome and are related to the local interaction mode of humans with their surroundings, as well as with the overall local ecological peculiarities. As trypanosomiasis caused by T. cruzi is primarily a zoonosis, understanding the variables that influences its transmission in the wild as well as the role played by the extant fauna in the maintenance of the parasite, is critical in establishing control measures. Here, we present the results of our studies of T. cruzi infection of free ranging wild mammalian fauna in the five biomes of Brazil, a country of continental dimensions. From 1992 up to 2017, we examined a total of 6587 free-ranging non-volant wild mammal specimens. Our studies found that 17% of mammals were seropositive and 8% of all animals displayed positive hemocultures indicative of high parasitemia and, consequently, of infectivity potential. We observed that opossums, mainly Philander spp. and Didelphis spp., the coati Nasua nasua, the capuchin monkey Sapajus libidinosus and the golden lion tamarin Leontopithecus rosalia, were mammal taxa that demonstrated higher rates of positive hemocultures. Additionally, Didelphis spp. demonstrated to be a competent bioaccumulator of TcI diversity. Chiroptera were distinguished for hosting the greatest diversity of species and genotypes of Trypanosoma spp. Additionally the observation of the higher host range of some Trypanosoma spp., shows the need to reassess the ecology of representatives of the taxon. Altogether, our results showed that each locality, may display distinct enzootiological and epidemiological scenarios that must be taken into account when it comes to establishing control and/or clarification campaigns of the local population."
"Haematozoa of Redwing and Greywing Francalin from three montane grassland habitats in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa","We examined blood smears collected from 28 Redwing Francolin Francolinus levaillantii and nine Greywing Francolin F. africanus from three montane grassland habitats in the highlands of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, from August 1996 to March 1997. Three haematozoan parasites were identified of which Leucocytozoon macleani and microfilaria were the most common and Trypanosoma avium the least common. The incidence of infections were higher in Redwing Francolin (64.3%) than in Greywing Francolin (11.1%). Francolins collected in grasslands which had been exposed to higher grazing pressures and more frequent burning had a higher prevalence of blood parasites. Infections with L. macleani were significantly (P < 0.01) greater in commercially grazed and frequently burnt grassland habitats than in less intensively utilized grasslands. Incidence of infection by haematozoa was inversely related to population density of Redwing Francolin. Haematozoal infections do not seem to pose any threat to population densities of these two grassland francolins within the study region."
"Seroepidemiological study of canine Leishmania infantum and Toxoplasma gondii infections in Shanghai, China, and analysis of risk factors","The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum and Toxoplasma gondii among household dogs in Shanghai (the most important industrial and commercial city in China), and to assess the possible risk factors associated with the infection. During 2014-2015, a total of 408 sera were collected from healthy household dogs and tested for L. infantum and T. gondii infection using commercial ELISA kits. The endemic characteristics according to gender, age group and breed were revealed by statistical descriptions and inference. The positive rates of L. infantum infection (24/408, 5.9%) were lower than those of T. gondii infection (37/408, 9.1%), and co-infection with both parasites was detected in seven dogs (7/408, 1.7%). Seropositivity for either parasite was more likely associated with age: the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection ranged from 1.3% (dogs <= 1 year) - 18.7% (dogs>6 years), whereas that of L. infantum ranged from 1.3% (dogs <= 1 year) - 9.9 % (dogs>6 years). Interestingly, the rates of exposure to both L. infantum and T. gondii were higher in males than in females. Relatively higher exposure rates for L. infantum and T. gondii were also observed in crossbred dogs compared with purebred dogs. However, neither gender nor breed is likely a determining factor for infection with these two parasites (P > 0.05). Identification of the risk factors that underlie these differences may help in the prevention of L. infantum and T. gondii infection in household dogs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of L. infantum and T. gondii infection in household dogs in Shanghai, which shows that these two important parasites are still prevalent in this region. Therefore, it is necessary to take integrated strategies for prevention and control of infection in animals, which could help to reduce human infection in the region."
"American trypanosomiasis and associated risk factors in owned dogs from the major city of Yucatan, Mexico","Background: The American trypanosomiasis is a zoonosis caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). The disease is widely distributed throughout the American continent, affecting a wide range of hosts, including dogs. It is present in the canine population in the State of Yucatan, Mexico. However, no significant studies in owned dogs have been performed in the metropolitan area of Merida. A transversal study was conducted in 370 owned dogs from Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Methods: A cross-sectional study including 370 dogs was performed in a major city of Yucatan, Mexico, to detect IgG antibodies against T. cruzi. A commercial ELISA test kit was used and a chi-square test used to evaluate associated risk factors; odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were also estimated. Results: The indirect ELISA and western blot (WB) tests were used to detect specific immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. cruzi in serum samples. A prevalence of 12.2 % was found; age and area of residence were statistically associated with seropositivity in dogs (p <0.05). Conclusions: Results from the present study suggests the presence and abundance of the vector in urban conditions where a high number of seropositive cases of T. cruzi cases were found."
Epidemiological Survey of Trypanosoma cruzi Infection in Domestic Owned Cats from the Tropical Southeast of Mexico,"American trypanosomiasis is an infectious disease of importance for public health and caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi mainly transmitted by triatomine bugs. The precise role of cats in the peridomestic transmission of T.cruzi and the mechanism by which cats become infected remain uncertain. The objective of this work was to determine the prevalence of T.cruzi infection in domestic cats from an urban area of tropical Mexico by serological and molecular methods and evaluate associated risk factors. A total of 220 domestic cats from Merida Yucatan, Mexico, were studied. Animals older than 3 months were blood sampled. Serum and DNA were obtained. Specific T.cruzi IgG antibodies were detected using a commercial indirect ELISA with an anti-cat antibody HRP labelled. Positive cases were confirmed by Western blot (WB). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also performed using the primers TC1 and TC2. From the 220 cats, 8.6% had antibodies against T.cruzi using ELISA test and later confirmed by WB. In 75 cats (34%), the sequence of ADNk of T.cruzi was amplified. The badregular body condition was the only risk factor associated with PCR positive to T.cruzi (P < 0.001). In Mexico, there are no previous epidemiological reports that demonstrate the importance of the cat as a reservoir of T.cruzi. Few individuals were identified with a serological response because they were probably at an early stage of infection or antibodies were not detected because they could be immunocompromised (FIV, FeLV or others). It is necessary to monitor PCR-positive patients and conduct further studies for better understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of Chagas disease in domestic cats."
"Stray Dogs as Reservoirs of the Zoonotic Agents Leptospira interrogans, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Aspergillus spp. in an Urban Area of Chiapas in Southern Mexico","This investigation determined the presence and prevalence of the zoonotic agents Leptospira interrogans, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Aspergillus spp. in the stray dog population (a total of 224 stray dogs) in an urban area of Southern Mexico. Blood serum samples were taken from all dogs, and root hair samples were taken from dogs with skin lesions and partial alopecia. IgG antibodies for L. interrogans from 10 serovars were detected using the microscopic agglutination test. Immunofluorescence antibody test and Western blot assay were used for serologic diagnosis of T. cruzi. The Sabouraud medium was used to isolate Aspergillus spp. Prevalence of L. interrogans was 4.9%, which was determined by identifying only serovars Pyrogenes, which accounted for 3.6%, and Tarassovi, which constituted 1.3%, with titers from 1:100 to 1:800. Additionally, T. cruzi antibodies were detected in 4.5% of the dogs. Skin lesions were found in 43% of the dogs (98/224), and 35 cultures were positive for Aspergillus spp. (35.7%, p < 0.05, 95% confidence interval 2.45-3.67), identified as A. niger (82.8%), A. flavus (14.3%), and A. terreus (2.9%). This study demonstrates the presence of certain zoonotic agents (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi) in stray dogs living within the studied area. Dogs play an important role in the transmission of diseases that are potentially harmful to humans. Although the prevalence of canine leptospirosis and trypanosomiasis is not high in Southern Mexico compared with other tropical regions of Mexico, the presence of these zoonotic agents in the stray dog population demonstrates that the stray dog population in this region is a significant reservoir and potential source of infection in humans. Special care should be taken when handling stray dogs that exhibit skin lesions with partial alopecia, since a pathological Aspergillus sp. fungus may be present."
"American Trypanosomiasis in Dogs from an Urban and Rural Area of Yucatan, Mexico","American trypanosomiasis in dogs is reported from South of the United States to Argentina and Chile. It is transmitted through the contact of dogs with reduviid insects when they feed; reduviid insects are well established in the southern state of Yucatan, Mexico. However, there are no reports available about trypanosomiasis prevalence in dogs of urban and rural areas. A cross-sectional study was performed in 345 stray dogs, 102 from a rural community of Yucatan (Tunkas) and 243 from Merida, capital city of the Yucatan state. Serum samples were obtained for detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi by indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western blot. DNA was extracted from whole blood of urban dogs for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Prevalence was determined and the risk to become infected in both urban and rural dogs was evaluated using a 2 X 2 contingency table. In addition to the effect of body condition score (BCS), the age and sex of dogs were also evaluated to determine the risk of infection. Antibody prevalence against T. cruzi in rural areas was 9.8%, whereas in urban dogs was 14.4%. When PCR results were included, prevalence in dogs from the urban area increased to 17.3%. PCR allowed the detection of active asymptomatic acute-phase disease. The risk to become infected was not different between urban and rural areas, suggesting that the vector is well adapted both to rural areas and urban sprawling. Dogs with poor BCS tended to have a higher probability of seroreactivity to T. cruzi proteins than dogs with regular or good BCS (p = 0.05)."
Investigation of risk areas as complemental methodology for the control of canine visceral leishmaniasis,"Risk areas of canine visceral leishmaniasis in the city of Camacari, Bahia, Brazil, were investigated. A total of 278 dogs from 141 homes pertaining to 20 investigated risk areas was serologically screened ( ELISA). The general seroprevalence was 21.7% ( 56/ 258) after exclusion of 20 dogs used at the beginning of the survey to limit the study area. The respective results of the univariated and multivariated analysis of factors related to infection of dogs by Leishmania chagasi, to vector distribution pattern in the area and to the methodology used to localize the canine focuses are discussed."
Modeling and comparative study of the spread of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis from Northern to Central Tunisia,"During the last twenty years, zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) spread from the north characterized by humid, sub-humid, and semi-arid bio-climates to the arid areas located in Central Tunisia. In order to understand the eco-epidemiological factors involved in the distribution of ZVL, both a sero-epidemiological and an entomological investigation were performed in two governorates situated in two different bio-geographical areas: Bizerte in the north and Kairouan in the center. A mathematical model for transmission of ZVL was built, describing the disease dynamic in these areas. Among 108 sera collected from clinically healthy owned dogs used for guarding houses in the governorate of Bizerte and tested for anti-L. infantum antibodies by indirect immune-fluorescence antibody test (IFAT), 8.3% were positive. From a total of 191 serum samples collected from clinically healthy owned dogs used for guarding houses in the governorate of Kairouan and tested for anti-L. infantum antibodies by IFAT, 26.7% were sero-positive. The cumulative incidences of ZVL in humans in the governorates of Bizerte and Kairouan were 39.17/100,000 and 0.2/100,000 inhabitants, respectively. The infection rates of sand flies with Leishmania DNA in the governorate of Bizerte and Kairouan were 3.8% and 9.4%, respectively. It is important to point out that ZVL epidemic in humans is preceded or concomitant to a high prevalence of Leishmania infantum in dogs and in sand flies. The model showed also a non-linear relationship between dog infection and ZVL in humans. These results suggest an important force of infection (RO) in emerging foci such as the governorate of Kairouan leading to an increased incidence of ZCL in humans. A high prevalence of L.infantum in dogs will result in high prevalence in the vector and obviously high probability to infect human; that it is a key factor for triggering transmission to humans, and subsequently it is an important parameter in the control of ZVL transmission."
"Serological Evidence of Leishmania donovani Infection in Apparently Healthy Dogs using Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) and rk39 Dipstick Tests in Kafta Humera, north-west Ethiopia","P>Leishmania (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) are protozoan parasites of significant medical and veterinary importance. Over the last decade, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has emerged as a major opportunistic infection associated with HIV/AIDS in North Western Ethiopia. This paper reports on serological evidence of possible Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) infection in dogs using two serological tests: direct agglutination test (DAT) and Kalazar detect rapid test (KDRT). Two hundred and seventeen asymptomatic local breed dogs were examined for L. donovani antibodies. Performance of the DAT and KDRT was assessed in 162 matching samples of blood collected on filter paper and serum, respectively. Using DAT and KDRT testing in parallel, the overall seroprevalence of L. donovani infection was 27.7% and 14.8%, respectively. The degree of agreement was found to be fair (68.8%, k = 0.234). Univariable logistic regression analysis of some risk factors for L. donovani infection in dogs using DAT indicates that place of residence, sex, age, dog keeping purpose and dog housing condition were not significantly associated with seropositivity. The high proportion of positive dogs suggests the exposure of these animals to L. donovani infection and needs further investigation. Isolation and typing of the parasite aiming at confirming the role of these animals in maintenance and transmission of kala-azar is advocated."
PREVALENCE OF TRYPANOSOMIASIS AMONG TRYPANOTOLERANT CATTLE AT THE LOWER BENUE RIVER AREA OF NIGERIA,"The prevalence of trypanosome infection among trypanotolerant breeds of cattle (Muturu, N'Dama and Keteku) and their crosses was investigated in the lower Benue area of northern Nigeria. Prevalence was negative in yearlings of all breeds and low in N'Dama (5.9%; confidence interval (CI) +/-6%), high in Keteku (25%; CI+/-30%) and with an average of 9.0% (CI-+/-3%) in all animals sampled. Trypanosoma viuax was the most predominant species encountered; it was diagnosed in 3.4% of all 268 heads of cattle and accounted for 37.5% of all 24 positive cases. Corresponding figures for T. congolense were 3.0% and 33.3%, respectively. Prevalence was influenced by age and breed (but not sex) of animal, and by intensity of management and season of year. It was highest among old (6-9 year) animals (11.9%; CI+/-9%), extensively managed stock (14.4%; CI+-6%), cross breeds (12.1%; CI+/-11%) and during the rains (10.2% CI+/-4%). Mean packed cell volume among infected (28.9+/-5.7%) and healthy (33.0+/-3.8%) animals did not differ significantly, and clinical signs of the disease were rarely observed. It is suggested that these breeds be incorporated into animal production programmes at the local government level."
"Current status of tsetse fly and animal trypanosomosis on the Jos plateau, Nigeria","Blood samples were collected from 1035 systematically selected zebu (White Fulani) cattle resident in two Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the Jos Plateau, and analysed for infections with trypanosomes. Their grazing grounds were also sampled For tsetse flies using unbaited blue Challier (biconical) traps. Mean prevalence of trypanosome infection was 6.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) +/- 0.02) and 9.1% (CI +/- 0.02) in Barkin-Ladi and Bassa LGAs, respectively. Higher infection rate was recorded during the rains (9.3%; CI +/- 0.02) than in the dry season months (1.5%; CI +/- 0.02). In both localities prevalence in cows (8.9%; CI +/- 0.04) consistently doubled that in bulls (4.0%; CI +/- 0.01). Also, infection rates increased with age until the 7th year. Trypanosoma vivax was both the predominant species and the only one diagnosed among yearlings. Only riverine tsetse species were encountered (apparently at low density) as infected vectors."
"Prevalence of symbionts and trypanosome infections in tsetse flies of two villages of the ""Faro and Deo"" division of the Adamawa region of Cameroon","Background: Tsetse flies are vectors of human and animal African trypanosomiasis. In spite of many decades of chemotherapy and vector control, the disease has not been eradicated. Other methods like the transformation of tsetse fly symbionts to render the fly refractory to trypanosome infection are being evaluated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between trypanosome infections and the presence of symbionts in these tsetse species. Tsetse flies were trapped in two villages of the ""Faro and Deo"" Division of the Adamawa region of Cameroon. In the field, tsetse fly species were identified and their infection by trypanosomes was checked by microscopy. In the laboratory, DNA was extracted from their midguts and the presence of symbionts (Sodalis glossinidius and Wolbachia sp.) and trypanosomes was checked by PCR. Symbionts/trypanosomes association tests were performed. Results: Three tsetse fly species including Glossina tachinoides (90.1%), Glossina morsitans submorsitans (9.4%) and Glossina fuscipes fuscipes (0.5%) were caught. In all the population we obtained an occurrence rate of 37.2% for Sodalis glossinidius and 67.6% for Wolbachia irrespective to tsetse flies species. S. glossinidius and Wolbachia sp. occurrence rates were respectively 37 and 68% for G. tachinoides and 28.6 and 59.5% for G. m. submorsitans. Between Golde Bourle and Mayo Dagoum significant differences were observed in the prevalence of symbionts. Prevalence of trypanosomes were 34.8% for Glossina tachinoides and 40.5% for Glossina morsitans submorsitans. In G. tachinoides, the trypanosome infection rates were 11, 2.6 and 13.7%, respectively, for T. brucei s.l., T. congolense forest type and T. congolense savannah type. In G. m. submorsitans, these infection rates were 16.7, 9.5 and, 2.4% respectively, for T. brucei s.l., T. congolense forest type and T. congolense savannah type. Conclusions: The rate of tsetse fly infection by trypanosomes was low compared to those obtained in HAT foci of south Cameroon, and this rate was not statistically linked to the rate of symbiont occurrence. This study allowed to show for the first time the presence of Wolbachia sp. in the tsetse fly sub-species Glossina morsitans submorsitans and Glossina tachinoides."
"Vector and reservoir surveillance study in a canine and human leishmaniasis endemic area in most western part of Turkey, Karaburun","Leishmaniasis is an arthropod borne disease that is endemic in 102 countries and one and half million new cases are reported each year. Sand flies are the one and only proven vectors of the disease and dogs are the main reservoirs in urban areas. Karaburun peninsula is located in most western part of Turkey and is reported to be an endemic area for human and canine leishmaniasis. The most recent study was undertaken more than 15 years ago in The peninsula and no clear data available for vectors or reservoirs. Thus, we aimed to update the information regarding sand fly diversity, infection status of reservoirs and vectors in the study area. Sand flies were collected using CDC light traps at 13 different sites of Karaburun and species identification was made using previously published keys. Monospecific pools were generated using midguts with blood retention and were screened for the presence of Leishmania spp. DNA by molecular techniques. A non-invasive conjunctival swab sampling was performed to identify the infection status among reservoirs and species typing of the causative agent was also undertaken using ITS1 PCR. Three out of 30 pools were found positive for Leishmania infantum that were generated using guts of Phlebotomus tobbi (n:36). Among all sampled dogs (44) and cats (19), 11 and one of them were found positive for L. infantum, respectively. There was a decrease in the number of P. papatasi during the study period, while increase was observed in the number of P. tobbi. The presence of proven vectors and reservoirs as well as Leishmania DNA in cats was shown in the present study. Sand fly fauna is updated and Leishmania DNA presence in cats was reported in the study area for the first time."
"Evaluation of conjunctival swab sampling in the diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis: A two-year follow-up study in Cukurova Plain, Turkey","The diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs is a very important and problematic public health issue in Turkey. A longitudinal study was carried out on dogs in selected villages in the Cukurova Plain in Turkey, from July 2011 to June 2013, where cutaneous (CL) and visceral (VL) leishmaniasis is endemic. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of CanL and to evaluate the early diagnostic performance of the non-invasive conjunctival swab nested PCR (CS n-PCR) test in comparison with the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT). The consecutive blood and CS samples from a representative number of dogs (80-100 dogs/each survey) were collected in a cohort of 6 villages located in the area. Clinical symptoms, demographic and physical features about each dog were noted and lymph node aspiration samples were obtained from selected dogs with lymphadenopathy. In four surveys during the period, a total of 338 sets (blood and CS) of samples from 206 dogs were obtained, such that 83 dogs were sampled more than once. In the cross-sectional analysis, the CanL prevalence was found to be 27.18% (between 7.14% and 39.13%) by IFAT and 41.74% (between 29.03% and 46.66%) by CS n-PCR. The isolated strains were identified as Leishmania infantum MON-1 (n = 9) and MON-98 (n = 2) by MLEE analysis. Genetic studies targeting the Hsp70 and ITS1 regions performed on 11 dog isolates also showed two clear separate groups. According to IFAT results, 24 of the 83 dogs sampled more than once showed seroconversion (n = 19) or a four-fold increase in Ab titers (n = 5), while 17 were positive in the initial screening. Forty-two dogs stayed negative during the whole period. The natural Leishmania exposure rate was detected as 31.14% in the study area. CS n-PCR only detected Leishmania infection earlier than IFAT in 8 dogs. No statistical difference was found after the analysis of demographical and physical data. The results indicated that (i) circulation of the dog population is very common in settlements in the Cukurova Plain, but the disease prevalence is high and stable, (ii) the performance of CS n-PCR for detecting Leishmania-dog contact is higher than IFAT, (iii) and some of the parasites isolated from dogs have different zymodemes and/or genotypes from previous human and sand fly isolates; suggesting the probability of two different cycles of leishmaniasis in this particular area. This hypothesis should be supported by future studies targeting vectors and-reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Natural infections of small mammals with blood parasites on the borderland of boreal and temperate forest zones,"Blood parasites of small mammals living in Bialowieta Forest (eastern Poland) were investigated between 1996 and 2002. The following haemoparasite species were found: Trypanosoma (Herpetosoma) evotomys in bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus; T. (H.) microti in root vole Microtus oeconomus; Babesia microti in root vole; Hepatozoon erhardovae in bank vole and Hepatozoon sp. in root vole. Some non-identified Bartonella species were found in bank vole, root vole, field vole Microtus agrestis, yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis, common shrew Sorex araneus, Eurasian water shrew Neomys fodiens, and Mediterranean water shrew N. anomalus. The prevalence and diversity of blood parasites were lower in shrews than small rodents. Totally, 52.0% of bank voles, 50.0% of root voles, 32.5% of common shrews, and 41.2% of Eurasian water shrews were infected with any of the blood parasites. Mixed infections were seldom observed in bank vole (17.3% of investigated individuals) and root vole (14.7%). No animals were infected with three or four parasites simultaneously. Infection of Bialowie a small mammals with haemoparasites seemed to be similar to those described in other temperate forest regions rather than boreal ones. Infection rates of rodent species seem to be higher in their typical habitats: for bank vole it was the highest in mixed forest, whereas for root vole in sedge swamp. The results suggest that Arvicolidae play a greater role than Muridae or Soricidae in maintenance of Babesia and Hepatozoon foci in natural environments of central Europe."
Blood parasites of the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius and their morphological characteristics,"Blood parasites of Apodemus agrarius were investigated in Eastern Slovakia during 1998-2005. The following parasitic species were detected: Trypanosoma grosi, Babesia microti-like piroplasms and Bartonella sp. Trypanosoma grosi was the most common species, with an infection prevalence of 12.7%. Trypanosomes were morphologically typical of the lewisi group, however, they were bigger than T. grosi described in A. flavicollis and A. sylvaticus. The differences analysed by nested analysis of variance were statistically significant. Pleomorphism was not observed. Infections with piroplasms were detected only at two sites, with an intensity of infection not exceeding 0.1%. The morphology of the piroplasms was different from those typical of B. microti. Bartonella occurred at two sites in 0.81% of the animals sampled. The prevalence of infection had a seasonal pattern throughout the study years. Trypanosomes occurred from July to November, with a peak in September, piroplasms occurred in May and June, and Bartonella sp. from May to July."
"Trypanosoma (Megatrypanum) ornata sp. n., a Parasite of the Eurasian Water Shrew Neomys fodiens (Pennant, 1771)","Infection with the new trypanosome species Trypanosoma ornata sp. n. was detected in water shrews Neomys fodiens examined for presence of blood parasites in September 2003 and 2004 in Bialowieza Forest (eastern Poland). The prevalence of infection was about 36.3% (4 out of 11 shrews examined). The parasites were described based on light microscopic characteristics, from 100 parasites isolated from blood of four infected animals. The trypanosomes occurred as trypomastigote forms only. Body length ranged from 20.50-38.26 mu m (mean 26.66 mu m), and width from 1.93-4.12 mu m (mean 3.06 mu m), with the free flagellum 3.12 +/- 1.26 long, sometimes absent. Other morphological features of the species (small kinetoplast, sometimes the vermiform posterior end, the surface of the cell markedly striated with longitudinal ""myonemes"", short or absent free flagellum) Support its affiliation to the Megatrypanum subgenus. The study provides the first detailed description of trypanosomes occurring in the Eurasian water shrew Neomys fodiens."
Epidemiology of dog-mediated zoonotic diseases in Algeria: a One Health control approach,
Analysis of host genetic factors influencing African trypanosome species infection in a cohort of Tanzanian Bos indicus cattle,"Trypanosomosis caused by infection with protozoan parasites of the genus Trypanosoma is a major health constraint to cattle production in many African countries. One hundred and seventy one Bos indicus cattle from traditional pastoral Maasai (87) and more intensively managed Boran (84) animals in Tanzania were screened by PCR for the presence of African animal trypanosomes (Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma brucei), using blood samples archived on ETA cards. All cattle screened for trypanosomes were also genotyped at the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II DRB3 locus to investigate possible associations between host MHC and trypanosome infection. Overall, 23.4% of the 171 cattle tested positive for at least one of the three trypanosome species. The prevalence of individual trypanosome species was 8.8% (T. congolense), 4.7% (T. vivax) and 15.8% (T. brucei). The high prevalence of T. brucei compared with T. congolense and T. vivax was unexpected as this species has previously been considered to be of lesser importance in terms of African bovine trypanosomosis. Significantly higher numbers of Maasai cattle were infected with T. brucei (23.0%, p = 0.009) and T. congolense (13.8%, p = 0.019) compared with Boran cattle (8.3% and 3.6%, respectively). Analysis of BoLA-DRB3 diversity in this cohort identified extensive allelic diversity. Thirty-three BoLA-DRB3 PCR-RFLP defined alleles were identified. One allele (DRB3*15) was significantly associated with an increased risk (odds ratio, OR = 2.71, p = 0.034) of T. brucei infection and three alleles (DRB3*35, *16 and *23) were associated with increased risk of T. congolense infection. While further work is required to dissect the role of these alleles in susceptibility to T. brucei and T. congolense infections, this study demonstrates the utility of FTA archived blood samples in combined molecular analyses of both host and pathogen.

Prevalence of trypanosome infections in marine fishes from western Norway,"Marine fishes from several locations along the west coast of Norway were examined for trypanosome infections. In total, 1640 fishes representing 63 species and 33 families were examined for trypanosome infections. Of these, 19 species of teleosts from eight families were found to be infected, mostly benthic codfish and flatfish in addition to Chelidonichthys gurnardus (L.) and Lophius piscatorius L. Trypanosomes in all fish species appeared to belong to a single form, considered identical to a trypanosome transmitted by the leech Calliobdella nodulifera (Malm, 1863). In the fjords near Bergen, west Norway, trypanosome infections appeared to be restricted to fishes caught deeper than 50 m, probably reflecting a limited bathymetric distribution of the leech vector. Available evidence suggests that the trypanosome parasitaemias decline and become undetectable in a year or less. Despite this, prevalence appeared unaffected by fish size in some species and increased with length in some slow growing species. The latter observations suggest that repeated infections occur, signifying that acquired immunity does not protect against re-infections."
"Eco-epidemiology of porcine trypanosomosis in Karim Lamido, Nigeria: prevalence, seasonal distribution, tsetse density and infection rates","Background: Animal trypanosomosis is a major economic disease in Nigeria causing considerable morbidity and mortality in livestock. Despite reports in other animals, the disease is under reported in pigs. Methods: We conducted a community based epidemiological study on African animal trypanosomosis in Karim Lamido area of Taraba State, Nigeria using species-specific PCR on 712 pigs and 706 of the 2822 captured tsetse flies. Data were analysed using Chi-square, odds ratio and multivariate analysis at 95 % confidence interval. Results: Overall prevalence of porcine trypanosomosis was 16.6 % and ranged between 2.0 and 8.8 % across Trypanosoma species. Seasonal distribution of porcine trypanosomosis varied significantly (chi(2) = 16.62, df = 3, P = 0. 0008) ranging between 7.9 and 23.6 % across seasons. Mixed infections involving T. b. brucei, T. congolense forest and T. congolense savannah recorded infection rates ranging between 2.5 and 9.3 %. There were significant variations between the trypanosome infection rates in relation to age (chi(2) = 7.629, df = 1, P = 0.0057, OR = 1.932, 95 % CI = 1.203-3.100), sex (chi(2) = 10.09, df = 1, P = 0.0015, OR = 2.085, 95 % CI = 1.315-3.304) and body condition (chi(2) = 22.10, df = 2, P < 0.0001) of pigs ranging between 10.4 and 30.3 %. Tsetse infection rates were 11.2 % (79/706) for Glossina palpalis and 6.8 % (48/706) for G. tachinoides yielding an overall infection rate of 18.0 %. Conclusion: Trypanosoma species are prevalent in the study area with similar distribution patterns in both pigs and tsetse flies. Late rainy season, adults, females and pigs with poor body condition recorded higher trypanosome infection rates. Of the three Trypanosoma spp. identified, T. b. brucei showed predominance."
"Prevalence of camel trypanosomosis and its vectors in Fentale district, South East Shoa Zone, Ethiopia","A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of camel trypanosomosis and assess the distribution and dynamics of the vectors responsible for transmission of the disease in five localities of Fentale district from September 2008 to January 2009. Parasitological examination was conducted using the microhaematocrit centrifugation technique (MHCT) and examination of Giemsa stained blood smears. The only species of trypanosome identified was Trypanosoma evansi with a prevalence of 4.7% by MHCT and 4.4% by blood smear. The prevalence was higher in male (6.8%) than female (4%) camels. With regard to age, calves (less than 2 years of age) were negative; the prevalence is high (7.7%) in young camels (between 3-4 years of age) and 4% in adult camels (older than 4 years of age). However, the difference in prevalence between sex and age groups was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The prevalence using blood smears was found to be different between different localities; the highest being 7.8% for Kobo and the lowest 2% for Haro kersa. The mean packed cell volume (PCV) of Trypanosoma evansi positive camels (22.43%) was significantly lower than that of negative camels (28.13%) (P<0.05). More than 99% of the biting flies captured from the study area were flies under the genus Stomoxys, while a few others such as Tabanus, Chrysops and Lyperosia were also captured. The highest fly count was recorded in September whilst the lowest was recorded in December. The current findings should not be generalized for all camel producing areas of the country or for all seasons in the same area. The prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi might be higher during the rainy season when the fly population (Tabanus) is expected to be high. Therefore, detailed studies should be carried out involving different seasons and the relative importance of different vectors in transmission of the disease in different ecologies."
Detection of Leishmania donovani and L-tropica in Ethiopian wild rodents,"Human visceral (VL, also known as Kala-azar) and cutaneous (CL) leishmaniasis are important infectious diseases affecting countries in East Africa that remain endemic in several regions of Ethiopia. The transmission and epidemiology of the disease is complicated due to the complex life cycle of the parasites and the involvement of various Leishmania spp., sand fly vectors, and reservoir animals besides human hosts. Particularly in East Africa, the role of animals as reservoirs for human VL remains unclear. Isolation of Leishmania donovani parasites from naturally infected rodents has been reported in several endemic countries; however, the status of rodents as reservoirs in Ethiopia remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated natural Leishmania infections in rodents. Animals were trapped in 41 localities of endemic and non-endemic areas in eight geographical regions of Ethiopia and DNA was isolated from spleens of 586 rodents belonging to 21 genera and 38 species. Leishmania infection was evaluated by real-time PCR of kinetoplast (k)DNA and confirmed by sequencing of the PCR products. Subsequently, parasite species identification was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing of the 18S ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer one (ITS1) gene. Out of fifty (8.2%) rodent specimens positive for Leishmania kDNA-PCR and sequencing, 10 were subsequently identified by sequencing of the ITS1 showing that five belonged to the L. donovani complex and five to L tropica. Forty nine kDNA-positive rodents were found in the endemic localities of southern and eastern Ethiopia while only one was identified from northwestern Ethiopia. Moreover, all the ten ITS1-positive rodents were captured in areas where human leishmaniasis cases have been reported and potential sand fly vectors occur. Our findings suggest the eco-epidemiological importance of rodents in these foci of leishmaniasis and indicate that rodents are likely to play a role in the transmission of leishmaniasis in Ethiopia, possibly as reservoir hosts.

Detection of Trypanosoma congolense and T-brucei subspecies in cattle in Zambia by polymerase chain reaction from blood collected on a filter paper,"To facilitate epidemiology studies of African trypanosomiasis in cattle in Zambia, we adapted a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using blood spotted on filter papers. For easy preparation of template DNA from the dried blood, we adapted a simple DNA extraction method using Chelex-100, an anion-exchange resin. Using primers directed for repetitive nuclear DNA sequences, species-specific DNA amplifications were detected from the blood of rats infected with Zambian isolates of T. congolense and T. brucei subspecies. The method was sensitive enough to detect a single trypanosome for both species. In the Eastern Province of Zambia, 240 cattle were examined for motile flagellates in the buffy coat by the microhematocrit method, and 100 of them were positive for the test. These 100 animals were further examined by thin blood smears and PCR for species identification. The thin blood smear revealed 62 and 14 animals with T. congolense and T. brucei subspecies infection, respectively, whereas the PCR detected 73 of the former and 38 of the latter species. These results indicate that dried blood spots on filter papers are a useful source of DNA for detection of African trypanosomes by PCR."
"Prevalence of haemoparasites, leptospires and coccobacilli with potential for human infection in the blood of rodents and shrews from selected localities in Tanzania, Namibia and Swaziland","The prevalence of haemoparasites, leptospirosis and Yersinia pestis was investigated in rodents and shrews from Tanzania, Namibia and Swaziland. Blood smears originating from rodents and shrews from the three countries indicated the presence of Trypanosoma lewisi (72.7%; n =950), Bacillus spp. (25.6%; n =950), Borrelia sp. (0.01%; n =950) and bipolar coccobacilli (0.01%; n =950). The blood smears from Namibia (n =26) had no haemoparasites while only 1.33% (n =75) of those from Swaziland showed presence of T Leptospira interrogans was found in rodent blood sera from Tanzania in the following serogroup proportions (n =350): Icterohaemorrhagiae (0.29%), Pomona (2.86%), Hardjo (1.14%), Bullum (0.86%), Grippotyphosa (1.43%) and Canicola (1.14%). Serodiagnosis of antibodies against the F1 antigen of Y pestis using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was negative for all the serum samples from central Tanzania, while two samples of serum from two species of rodents, Rhabdomys pumilio and Gerbilliscus leucogaster, collected in the Kavango Region of Namibia were positive. These results suggest an enzootic plague activity in this region in Namibia. It is concluded that zoonotic agents, that are infectious to humans, are prevalent in rodents and shrews in the three countries, and that local communities should apply rodent control measures to reduce the risk of human infections."
Short Report: Molecular Mass Screening to Incriminate Sand Fly Vectors of Andean-type Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Ecuador and Peru,"Sand flies from the Andean areas of Ecuador and Peru were examined for Leishmania infections by using our recently established molecular mass screening method. Leishmanial minicircle DNA-positive sand flies were detected in 3 of 192 and 1 of 462 samples from Ecuador and Peru, respectively. Sand fly species were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, and the positive flies were Lutzomyia (Lit.) ayacuchensis and Lu. peruensis, respectively. Furthermore, cytochrome h and mannose-phosphate isomerase gene sequence analyses identified the parasites from Ecuador and Peru as Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana and L. (Viannia) peruviana, respectively. Thus, the mass screening method was confirmed to be a powerful tool for sand fly research."
First Evidence of a Hybrid of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis/L. (V.) peruviana DNA Detected from the Phlebotomine Sand Fly Lutzomyia tejadai in Peru,"The natural infection of sand flies by Leishmania was examined in the Department of Huanuco of Peru, where cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by a hybrid of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis/L. (V.) peruviana is endemic. A total of 2,997 female sand flies were captured by CDC light traps and Shannon traps, of which 2,931 and 66 flies were identified as Lutzomyia tejadai and Lu fischeri, respectively. Using crude DNA extracted from individual sand flies as a template, Leishmania DNA was detected from one Lu. tejadai. The parasite species was identified as a hybrid of L. (V.) braziliensis/L. (V.) peruviana on the basis of cytochrome b and mannose phosphate isomerase gene analyses. The result suggested that Lu. tejadai is responsible for the transmission of the hybrid Leishmania circulating in this area."
Establishment of a mass screening method of sand fly vectors for Leishmania infection by molecular biological methods,"Surveillance of the prevalence of Leishmania and its vector, sand fly species, in endemic and surrounding areas is important for prediction of the risk and expansion of leishmaniasis. In this study, a method for the mass screening of sand flies for Leishmania infection was established. This method was applied to 319 field-captured specimens, and 5 positive sand flies were detected. Sand fly species were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 18S rRNA gene, and all the positive flies were Lu. hartmanni. Furthermore, cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene sequence analyses identified all the parasites as Endotrypanum species including a probable novel species. Because the method requires minimum effort and can process a large number of samples at once, it will be a powerful tool for studying the epidemiology of leishmaniasis."
Impact of 4% deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars on the prevalence and incidence of canine visceral leishmaniasis,
Epidemiology of canine leishmaniasis by cross-sectional study in the French focus of Cevennes,"A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was carried out on the distribution of canine leishmaniasis in the French focus of Cevennes. Animals were sampled in two vegetation zones : Holm and White Oak zone (WO/HO) and Holm Oak zone (HO) in which villages were chosen for collecting blood from dogs as exhaustively as possible. Sera from 259 dogs were collected and subjected to the indirect immunofluorescence antibodies test (IFAT) and counter immuno-electrophoresis (CIE). Scroprevalence was 17.9 % in the WO/HO level and 9.6 % in the HO level. Serological positivity to Leishmania sp. was significantly associated with a life in the WO/HO level, and sex, dog's activity and age were found to be additional factors. Basic reproductive number (R-0) was 1.21 in the WO/HO level and 1.11 in the HO level. Prevalence has moderately increased during the last ten years, especially in the peri-urban HO zone."
Haematozoa of wild catfishes in northern Australia,"Very little is known about the diversity, prevalence, or pathogenicity of haematozoa in Australian freshwater fishes. Blood smears from 189 native catfishes, of six different species, from northern Australia were examined for haematozoa. Haematozoan infections were observed only in fishes from Queensland, at an overall prevalence of 0.191 (95% CI = 0.134-0.265). Intraerythrocytic haemogregarines were present in Neoarius graeffei from the Brisbane River at a prevalence of 0.35 (0.181-0.567). Trypanosomes were present in Tandanus species from four rivers, at prevalences ranging from 0.111 (0.020-0.330) to 1 (0.635-1), and in N. graeffei from one river in Queensland, at a prevalence of 0.063 (0.003-0.305). The haematozoans observed appeared to have little impact on their hosts. Tandanus spp. were significantly more likely to be infected with trypanosomes, suggesting a high parasite-host specificity. This is the first widespread survey of wild Australian freshwater catfishes for haematozoa, resulting in the first report of haemogregarines from Australian freshwater fish, and the first report of trypanosomes from Neoarius graeffei and Tandanus tropicanus."
Preliminary survey of domestic animal visceral leishmaniasis and risk factors in north-west Ethiopia,"ObjectiveAfter the epidemics of L. donovani complex in 2004/05 in human patients, to investigate the presence of antibodies against L. donovani in domestic animals in north-west Ethiopia. MethodsTwo hundred and three domestic animals were screened. Serum and biopsy samples were collected. A modified direct agglutination test (DAT) for canine reservoirs was used to screen serum samples at 1:320 cut-off titre. Giemsa stain and culture on Novy macNeal Nicolae (NNN) media were used for biopsy samples. Pre-tested questionnaires were used to elicit information on potential risk factors. ResultsAntibody against L. donovani in domestic animals was detected in 30.5% of animals. The highest seropositivity rates were 41.9% in cattle, 40% in dogs, 33.3% in donkeys, 10% in goats and 4.8% in sheep. No Leishmania parasite was isolated from spleen, liver, skin snip and exudates, bone marrow or lymph node of dogs. Dogs owned by households with history of kala-azar treatment and humans sharing the house with cattle were more affected by visceral leishmaniasis (P<0.05). ConclusionThis study showed a high serological prevalence of leishmaniasis in domestic animals. Their role in the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis remains unclear."
"Molecular Identification of Trypanosomes and Their Effects on Hematological and Biochemical Parameters in Donkeys in Punjab, Pakistan","The study was designed to investigate the molecular identification and prevalence and of ttypanosomiasis and its effects on hematological and biochemical parameters in donkeys. Blood samples were collected from 657 donkeys of three districts: Gujranwala, Gujrat, and Mandi Bahaudin in Punjab province of Pakistan. Prevalence of Trypanosoma was observed by microscopy of Giemsa's stained blood smear; whereas, serum and hematological parameters were determined by serum biochemistry and hematologic analyzer, respectively. Multiplex PCR was used to differentiate the species of Trypanosoma in diseased animals Out of 657 donkeys screened 58 (8.83%) were detected positive for trypanosomiasis by microscopic examination. Gujranwala was found to have highest prevalence (11.58%) followed by Gujrat (8.23%) and Mandi Bahaudin (5.39%), respectively. Hemoglobin, red blood cells count, packed cell volume and mean corpuscular volume were significantly (P<0.05) lower in infected animals; whereas, total leucocyte count and lymphocyte count were significantly (P<0.05) higher in infected animals Total protein, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were significantly (P<0.05) increased in the infected animals Macrocyte, microcyte, acanthocyte, dacrocyte and bizarre shaped red blood cells were observed in infected animals Multiplex PCR showed that Trypanosoma evansi was the most prevalent species.

TRYPANOSOME OCCURRENCE AND PREVALENCE IN THE MARINE LEECH JOHANSSONIA-ARCTICA AND ITS HOST PREFERENCES IN THE NORTHWESTERN ATLANTIC-OCEAN,"In this study, the distribution, abundance, host selection, and prevalence of trypanosomes in the marine leech Johanssonia arctica in the northwestern Atlantic were investigated. This leech is widely distributed and is encountered more often in the Labrador - northeastern Newfoundland area, especially at depths of 165 m or more, where water temperatures of about O-degrees-C prevail. It rarely occurs south and west of Newfoundland, where warmer bottom temperatures occur. The highest prevalence of the trypanosome (Trypanosoma murmanensis) infection was found in leeches collected from a depth of 165 m in summer off the Labrador and north and east Newfoundland coasts in the largest leeches (approximately 25 mm). Samples taken at 3- to 5-month intervals in Conception Bay over a 7-year period showed that prevalence of the trypanosome infection is also greater in summer-autumn than during winter. The leeches sampled had fed predominantly on pleuronectiform (flatfish) rather than perciform or gadiform fish, and rarely on elasmobranchs. High prevalences of T. murmanensis in fish coincide with the abundance of J. arctica in several areas of the northwestern Atlantic. Since six other species of marine leeches apparently do not acquire trypanosome infections after feeding on infected fish, J. arctica is probably the major vector of the parasite in the northwestern Atlantic north of latitude 45-degrees-N."
PREVALENCE OF TRYPANOSOME INFECTIONS IN THE MARINE LEECH JOHANSSONIA-ARCTICA OFF EASTERN NEWFOUNDLAND,"A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of trypanosomal stages, indistinguishable from Trypanosoma murmanensis, in the marine leech Johanssonia arctica off eastern Newfoundland, Canada, from 1972 to 1990. Prevalence of the infection was highest between May and October, with a peak in July, and lowest during winter. The highest prevalences were also associated with a high percentage of engorged leeches in summer-autumn. Prevalence of infection in recently emerged leeches, following their first blood meal, was greater in July than at other times of the year. Similarly, the percentage of infection increased with age of the leech and was greater in summer than in winter. The number of leeches, as well as the prevalence of infection, decreased offshore. Prevalence of infection was observed to be substantially lower in saliva than in gut contents. A study of host preference on J. arctica indicated that a greater percentage of blood meals was taken from flatfish in summer; in winter, as the latter became submerged in sediment, there was a shift in feeding to eelpouts and wolffish. The prevalence of the infection was greater in fish, especially flatfish, closer to shore than in offshore areas and corresponds to the abundance of the vector. Results from the present study suggest that infections in the leech reach a peak during summer-autumn and are acquired mainly from flatfish, in which prevalence of the infection adjacent to the coast is highest."
"Seroepidemiological survey of canine Visceral leishemanisis in Sarab District, East Azerbaijan Province, Northwest of Iran in 2009","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is one of the most important endemic parasitic diseases in different parts of Iran. It is also a health problem in some tropical and subtropical countries. The purpose of the present study was to determine the seroprevalence of canine VL (CVL) in owned dogs of Sarab and to identify the isolated Leishmania species. Sera samples were taken from 384 dogs from 30 random villages around Sarab and tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of thirty five dogs were seropositive. The seroprevalence rate (SPR) of CVL was 9.1% (95 % CI; 6.6 - 12.4). Out of 361 (94%) asymptomatic dogs, 31 (8.6%) were seropositive, and out of 23 (6%) symptomatic dogs, 4 (17.4%) were seropositive. 306 (79.7%) dogs were male and 78 (20.3%) were female. 28 (9.2%) male dogs and 7 (9%) female dogs were seropositive. There was no statistically significant relation between sex and seroprevalence (p = 0.962). The largest age group was 2 - 4 years, with 170 (44.3%) dogs out of which only 18 dogs (10.5%) were seropositive. Agreement between the ELISA test and clinical signs was 86.7%. A significant difference in the presence of antibodies against Leishmania was seen between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs (p = 0.015). ELISA was efficiently sensitive in the identification of infected dogs and seems to be an appropriate tool in rapid diagnostic screenings. ELISA is highly recommended to be applied as a standard test for routine CVL diagnosis."
"Study on Seroprevalence of Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL) in Ownership Dogs of Sarab, East Azerbaijan, Province, Northwest of Iran with Indirect Immuno Fluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT) and its Health Importance in 2008-2009","This study was made to investigate the seroprevalence of Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) among the ownership dogs of villages in Sarab city and to find the possible relationship between to transmit of parasite from infected dogs to human beings. In this study blood sampling was made from 384 ownership dogs for recognizing seroprevalence of visceral Leishmaniasis with Indirect Immuno Fluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT). The serum was conjugated with anti leishmania infantom IgG antibodies and examined with fluorescent microscope. The seropervalence values among male and female animal were 9.2 and 6.5, respectively. Sero-Prevalence Rate (SPR) of CVL among ownership dogs in Sarab was 8.5% however, considering the cut off degree (1:80) from 384 dog 33 dogs of them was positive serum on the basis of anti L. infantom IgG antibodies. In this study, the antibody titer in male dogs was more than that of female dogs, however, it was not statistically significant (p = 0.023). The highest infection was found in dogs of jaldabakhan village 29.6% (8) and the lowest infection was found in khaki 3.3% (1). In this study only in Asbfroshan and Jaldabakhan areas 2 dogs had antibody 1:40, which was a negative serum antibody. There was statistically a significant difference between male and female infection to Visceral Leishmaniasis (p = 0.962). Considering the different animal reservoirs and various geographical animal conditions in this area and regarding the zooonotic parasite, controlling the animal reservoirs seems unavoidable and fighting against the vector sand fly and controlling plans are necessary."
"Parasitological prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in Kindo Koisha district, Wollaita zone, south Ethiopia","A cross sectional survey to determine the distribution and prevalence of trypanosomosis was conducted in Kindo Koisha district, in the Wollarta zone in southern Ethiopia A total of 1 008 adult cattle was examined at eight different localities Dark field examination of the buffy coat, as well as stained thin blood film examination and packed cell volume (PCV) evaluation were the diagnostic techniques used. The overall prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis was 15 % Among the positive animals, 108 (71 1 %), 43 (28.4 %) and 1 (0.6 %) were due to Trypanosoma vivax, Trypanosoma congolense and mixed infection (T vivax and T congolense), respectively. The infection rate of T vivax and T congolense varied significantly (P < 0.01). The mean PCV of the positive and negative animals ranged between 18 3-32.1 % and 26.8-33 4%, respectively. The mean PCV of negative animals (28 %) was significantly higher than the mean PCV of positive animals (22.3 %) (P < 0.001). There was an inverse association of PCV with the prevalence of trypanosomosis (P > 0.05) The herd average PCV values of each site decreased with increasing proportion of the positive herds of that particular site. Of the diagnostic tests employed, the microhaematocrit buffy coat technique is relatively sensitive and it has an added advantage of indicating the general condition of the animal by haematocrit measurement. In view of the risk of trypanosomosis, a control intervention through the strategic application of appropriate trypanocidal drugs is recommended A tsetse fly control scheme to reduce host-tsetse fly contact is equally as important as chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis against trypanosomosis."
Investigation of anti-toxoplasma gondii and anti-leishmania infantum antibodies among Sivas Kangal dogs,"The present study was carried out to determine the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and leishmaniosis among Kangal dogs on breeding farms in Sivas, Turkey. Serum samples from 50 Kangal dogs without clinical symptoms of disease were tested for anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies with the Sabin Feldman Dye Test (SFDT) and for anti- Leishmania antibodies with the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT). Forty- six out of the 50 dogs were seropositive for Toxoplasma gondii, with titers ranging from 1: 16 to 1: 1024. Only 1 of the 50 dogs was seropositive for leishmaniosis (titer: 1: 128) and 5 had anti- Leishmania antibodies with a titer of 1: 64, which was considered uncertain. There were no statistically significant differences in the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and leishmaniosis based the gender and age of the dogs (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the study revealed that Toxoplasma gondii is widely distributed in Kangal dogs. Although the seroprevalence of canine leishmaniosis among Kangal dogs was low and no clinical signs were observed, asymptomatic animals can be significant reservoirs for the spread of the disease."
Survey of bumble bee (Bombus) pathogens and parasites in Illinois and selected areas of northern California and southern Oregon,"Pathogens have been implicated as potential factors in the recent decline of some North American bumble bee (Bombus) species, but little information has been reported about the natural enemy complex of bumble bees in the United States. We targeted bumble bee populations in a state-wide survey in Illinois and several sites in California and Oregon where declines have been reported to determine presence and prevalence of natural enemies. Based on our observations, most parasites and pathogens appear to be widespread generalists among bumble bee species, but susceptibility to some natural enemies appeared to vary.

Distribution and characterization of canine Chagas disease in Texas,"Although acute and chronic cases of canine Chagas disease have been reported from multiple areas in the southern region of the United States, little data are available on current disease occurrence patterns in endemic areas. Therefore, a study to assess frequency, geographic distribution, signalment, and clinical spectrum of Chagas disease in domestic dogs from Texas was conducted. Serology, histopathology, and clinical case records from multiple institutions for the time period 1993-2007 were analyzed. A total of 537 serologically and/or histopathologically confirmed cases were documented. Cases were reported from 48 of 254 counties within Texas, covering all major geographic regions. Forty-eight dog breeds were represented among the cases, primarily in the sporting and working groups. In histopathologically confirmed cases, acute death occurred in 42%, approximately half of which were <1 year of age. Nearly all cases with histopathology data reported myocarditis (97.9%) and observation of Trypanosoma cruzi organisms (81.7%). Predominant clinical observations included enlarged heart, lethargy, anorexia, ascites, cardiac conduction disturbances, and respiratory difficulties. An increasing rate of serologic test submissions was noted over the study period, with an overall positive test prevalence of 20.3%. The study results provide strong evidence that an active canine Chagas disease transmission cycle is present throughout all ecoregions of Texas, affecting a broad range of dog breeds and age groups.

Evaluation of an Indirect-ELISA Test for Trypanosoma evansi Infection (Surra) in Buffaloes and Its Application to a Serological Survey in Thailand,"Surra, caused by Trypanosoma evansi, is a neglected disease due to frequent subclinical evolution, especially in bovines in Asia. However, acute and chronic signs are regularly observed, with significant sanitary and economic impacts. In this study, we evaluated and applied an indirect-ELISA test for the detection of anti-T. evansi immunoglobulin G in buffaloes using antibovine conjugate. Based on buffalo reference sera from the Philippines, a two-graph receiver operating characteristics analysis (TG-ROC) was conducted to define an optimal cut-off value; sensitivity and specificity were estimated at 92.5% and 94.2%, respectively. A crosssectional serological survey was carried out in the major buffalo breeding areas of Thailand; 892 buffaloes from 8 provinces were sampled in North, Northeastern, and Southern Thailand. Seropositive buffaloes were found in all 8 provinces, on 20.3% of farms for an overall prevalence of 12.2% (95% CI 10.2-14.5%). Nearly one-third of the sampled population was exposed to infection. Broader sampling would be necessary but is not possible in the southern half-wild breeding systems. According to our results, buffaloes may constitute a large and robust reservoir for T. evansi, which is a permanent threat to other livestock such as cattle and horses as well as wild animals such as elephants in Southest Asia."
Epidemiological study of kala-azar by direct agglutination test in two rural communities of eastern Nepal,"We conducted a sero-epidermological study of kala-azar in two endemic communities (Kasaini and Gidhaniya) situated in the Terai (plain) of eastern Nepal. Direct agglutination test (DAT) was used as a serological test for screening. Capillary blood samples were collected by filter paper method from 601 (96%) people of a total population of 628 in Kasaini and from 482 (94%) people of 515 in Gidhaniya. Positive DAT titres (1:2000) were found in 66 (6.09%) of 1083 sera tested. The male-female sero-prevalence ratio was 1.44:1 and the age group of 15 years and above was most affected. Among the bone marrow aspirates collected from 66 DAT seropositive cases, only 19 were positive for Leishmania donovani (LD bodies). Of the 47 DAT seropositive but LD bodies' negative cases, three were clinically active cases of kala-azar. Another nine developed clinical symptoms of kala-azar during 6 months follow-up and 23 were cases that had received prior treatment for kala-azar (within 1 year). The results of this study show the potential of the DAT on filter paper as a screening test for the surveillance of kala-azar at a community level."
Correlates of parasite load in bumblebees in an Alpine habitat,"Essentially, all animals face parasites, but little data are available on the rate of parasitism in wild animals, particularly in insects. Here, we report observations of more than 400 bumblebee workers collected at an Alpine site, including the parasites observed (Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, conopid parasitoid fly larvae and tracheal mites), as well as date of collection, bumblebee species and body variables (size, fat content, egg development and antibacterial activity). Among the 14 bumblebee species collected, C. bombi and tracheal mites reached a prevalence of approximately 10 and 6%, respectively, while conopids and N. bombi were almost absent. Correlations among the measured parameters suggest that larger workers are more likely to develop eggs and contain more tracheal mites. Across the season, we found a decrease in fat content but an increase in C. bombi and mite prevalence. Mites' fitness was higher in fatter bees and lower in bees with more tracheal mites. Antibacterial activity was found in approximately 10% of the workers, suggesting at least sporadic infection with bacteria."
"A seroepidemiological study of exposure to Toxoplasma, Leishmania, Echinococcus and Trichinella in equids in Greece and analysis of risk factors","The role of horses in the transmission of parasitic zoonoses either as a source of infection to vectors or through contamination of definitive hosts is gaining importance worldwide. For this reason sera from 773 equids including 753 horses, 13 mules and seven ponies in four regions of Greece were investigated by ELISA for the presence of IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma, Leishmania, Echinococcus and Trichinella. Anti-Toxoplasma antibodies were detected in all regions with an overall prevalence of 1.8%. In contrast, antibodies to Leishmania, Echinococcus, and Trichinella were present only in horses from the equestrian centre located in Attica region, but the status of Trichinella could not be confirmed. The seroprevalence of infection was 0.3% for Leishmania, 0.1% for Echinococcus and 0.1% for Trichinella. Only one horse was positive with a mixed infection of Toxoplasma, Leishmania and Trichinella. The following host characteristics were investigated for any significant effects on the prevalence of Toxoplasma infection: gender, age, species, origin of birth, activity, and location. The type of activity (p<0.05) and location (p<0.01) of the animals were found to be significant risk factors for Toxoplasma infection. The relative risk (RR) for Toxoplasma infection comparing the regions of Peloponnese and Thessaly to Attica were 6.92 and 6.78, respectively. Due to the very low prevalence of Echinococcus, Leishmania, and Trichinella infections, the associated risk factors were not analysed. The low seroprevalences observed suggest that the risk of infection from equids to people is very low, especially when consumption of horse meat is uncommon in this country. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Canine leishmaniosis and its relationship to human visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern Uzbekistan,"Background: The Namangan Region in the Pap District, located in Eastern Uzbekistan is the main focus of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Uzbekistan. In total, 28 cases of human VL were registered during 2006-2008 in this region. A study on the epidemiology of VL in this area was carried out in 2007-2008 in the villages of Chodak, Oltinkan, Gulistan and Chorkesar located at elevations of 900-1200 above sea level. Results: A total of 162 dogs were tested for Leishmania infection. Blood was drawn for serology and PCR. When clinical signs of the disease were present, aspirates from lymph nodes and the spleen were taken. Forty-two dogs (25.9%) had clinical signs suggestive of VL and 51 (31.5%) were sero-positive. ITS-1 PCR was performed for 135 dogs using blood and tissue samples and 40 (29.6%) of them were PCR-positive. Leishmanial parasites were cultured from lymph node or spleen aspirates from 10 dogs. Eight Leishmania strains isolated from dogs were typed by multi-locus microsatellite typing (MLMT) and by multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis (MLEE), using a 15 enzyme system. These analyses revealed that the strains belong to the most common zymodeme of L. infantum, i.e., MON-1, and form a unique group when compared to MON-1 strains from other geographical regions. Conclusions: The data obtained through this study confirm the existence of an active focus of VL in the Namangan region of Uzbekistan. The fact that L. infantum was the causative agent of canine infection with typical clinical signs, and also of human infection affecting only infants, suggests that a zoonotic form of VL similar in epidemiology to Mediterranean VL is present in Uzbekistan."
Host-specificity of Monoxenous Trypanosomatids: Statistical Analysis of the Distribution and Transmission Patterns of the Parasites from Neotropical Heteroptera,"Host-parasite relationships and parasite biodiversity have been the center of attention for many years; however the primary data obtained from large-scale studies remain scarce. Our long term investigations of trypanosomatid (Euglenozoa: Kinetoplastea) biodiversity from Neotropical Heteroptera have yielded almost one hundred typing units (TU) of trypanosomatids from one hundred twenty host species. Half of the parasites' TUs were documented in a single host species only but the rest were found parasitizing two to nine species of hosts, with logarithmic distribution best describing the observed distribution of parasites among hosts. Different host superfamilies did not show significant differences in numbers of trypanosomatid TUs they carry, with exception of Pyrrhocoroidea which showed higher parasite richness than any other group tested. Predatory reduviids shared significantly larger numbers of parasite TUs with phytophagous mirids and coreids than the numbers shared between any other groups. These results show that the specificity of trypanosomatid-heteropteran associations is not very strict: parasites seem to be transmissible between different host groups within the same niche and predatory hosts may acquire parasites from their prey.

"TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI IN FREE-RANGING MAMMALIAN POPULATIONS IN SOUTH TEXAS, USA","Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. It is a significant health concern in South and Central America, where millions of people are infected or at risk of infection, and is an emerging health concern in the US. The occurrence of Chagas disease in natural environments is supported by mammal host species, but those primary species may vary based on geographic location. In South Texas, the primary host species for the disease is poorly understood, and required a field study to determine the spatial distribution of T. cruzi prevalence in free-ranging mammals. Our study objectives were to determine the spatial distribution and prevalence of T. cruzi parasites in free-ranging mammals. We compared T. cruzi prevalence among species, among vegetative communities, and among different topographies (i.e., floodplain versus upland). From December 2011 through December 2013, 450 blood and tissue samples from geolocated free-ranging wildlife mammal species were analyzed with the use of polymerase chain reaction to detect protozoan T. cruzi DNA. We also calculated mammal abundance with the use of mark-recapture methodology and recorded capture-site characteristics such as vegetation structure. We found that animals in grasslands had a significantly lower infection rate when summed across all species compared with animals in dense hardwoods and semi-improved woodlands (P = 0.001). A higher percentage of infections were found in the lower-elevation floodplain-65% (28/43) of animals sampled, compared to upland areas-25% (9/36) of animals sampled. Our study suggested that common free-ranging meso-mammals supported T. cruzi in natural environments and are of public health concern in South Texas. Mitigation strategies should consider a range of management activities to include vegetation management, selective application of insecticides, and changes in human behavior in high-risk areas."
Haemosporida of birds of prey and owls from Germany,"A total of 1149 free-living birds of prey from Germany were examined for blood parasites. The prevalence of infection was 11% (adult birds 18%, immature birds 16%, nestlings 4%). Among the Falconiformes 11% of 976 birds were infected, and 13% of 173 Strigiformes. Out of 17 falconiform species nine were infected with blood parasites whereas the Eurasian buzzard (Buteo buteo) had the highest prevalence for haematozoa; i.e. Leucocytozoon toddi (31%), the highest prevalence (25%) for Haemoproteus sp. was found in the hobby (Falco subbuteo). Eight species of owls were examined for blood parasites; the tawny owl (Strix aluco) had the highest prevalence with Haemoproteus syrnii (22%). In the one pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) examined Trypanosoma avium and Plasmodium (Giovannolaia) fallax were detected. The white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) was found to be a host of L. toddi for the first time. Differences in the prevalence of blood parasites were found in the seasons and age classes of the birds but not between birds admitted to a rehabilitation centre or samples in the wild, the sexes, bird orders and the regions."

Age prevalence of trypanosomal infections in female Glossina morsitans morsitans (Diptera : Glossinidae) on the plateau area of eastern Zambia,"Trypanosomal infections in female Glossina morsitans morsitans were investigated in an area in the Eastern Province of Zambia between 1992 and 1994. A total of 4416 flies were captured, aged using the ovarian ageing method and screened for trypanosomal infections in both the mouthparts, salivary glands and the midgut. Congolense-type infections were identified in 4.8% of the flies. Vivax-type and immature infections were identified in 1.8% and 6.8% of the flies, respectively. The prevalence of congolense-type, vivax-type and immature infections increased with age. For vivax-type infections the age-prevalence relationship could be described by a model assuming a constant per capita rate of infection. For congolense-type and midgut infections, a polynomial term was added to the model significantly improving the fit. The per capita at which flies become infected was significantly higher for immature compared to mature infections. Observations strongly suggest that tsetse acquire new midgut infections at any age and that maturation of these infections is not limited to those obtained during the first blood meal."
Sero-surveillance for surra in cattle using native surface glycoprotein antigen from Trypanosoma evansi,"Surra, caused by Trypanosoma evansi affects a wide range of domestic and wild animals in the tropics, taking a huge toll on the already impoverished economy here. In bovines surra normally develops into a chronic infection that is often associated with severe production losses, yet with no distinct clinical signs making its adequate diagnosis vital. Though direct microscopic observation of T. evansi in circulation may be the diagnostic gold standard for surra, it is insensitive and impractical for population prevalence studies, making sero, diagnosis the preferred choice for the latter. In this study, we standardize an ELISA with Concanavalin-A (Con-A) affinity purified T. evansi surface glycoprotein antigen and compare its sensitivity and specificity to direct microscopy of stained thin smears and molecular (PCR) diagnostics. The ELISA was then put on field trial for sero-surveillance of cattle for surra in three geographically distinct populations in the Indian subcontinent, to yield an overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 89.15% compared to standard stained thin smear examinations and 95.23% and 90.84% compared to blood PCR examinations.

"Study on sero-prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection in cattle, buffaloes and horses by antibody detection enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","An indirect ELISA test using crude sonicated whole cell lysate (WCL) antigens of Trypanosoma evansi, was standardized to detect anti-T evansi antibodies (Abs) in serum samples of cattle, buffaloes and horses collected randomly from slaughterhouse, villages, organized cattle farm and horse stables of eastern region of India. Ab-detection test revealed the presence of anti-T evansi Abs in 20.68% and 11.11% sera samples of slaughtered cattle and buffaloes, respectively, in 5.71% sera samples of cattle collected from villages and in 10% sera samples of horses. The sera samples collected from an organized cattle farm were negative for anti-T evansi antibodies. The significance of presence of anti-T evansi Abs in large numbers of slaughtered animals was discussed."
Twice upon a time: The progression of canine visceral leishmaniasis in an Argentinean city,"Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL) prevalence, spatial distribution and associated factors were assessed in four locations in Iguazu department in 2014 and in Puerto Iguazu city again in 2018. The city areas were divided into a grid of 400x400m cells. All cells were sampled in 2014 and a random subsampling was developed in 2018. In each cell, five dogs clustered in a 'critical scenario' (prone to have vectors) were sampled. A rapid immunochromatographic dipstick was used to detect antibodies against Leishmania infantum, confirming by lymph node smears observation and PCR. For Puerto Iguazu, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were constructed considering environmental, dog and clinical variables. Pearson's Chi square and Fisher's exact tests were employed to evaluate the association between CVL, dog clinical signs and infestation with other parasites. Cartographic outputs were made and Moran's I indices were calculated as spatial autocorrelation indicators. CVL prevalence rates were 26.18% in 2014 and 17.50% in 2018. No associations were established in environmental models, but dog age and repellent use were significant when running 2014 dog models. Clinical models showed significant associations between seropositive dogs and ophthalmological, dermal signs and onychogryphosis in 2014. In 2018, only adenomegaly was associated. The results of global Moran's I were not significant but regarding local analysis, six sites in 2014 and one in 2018 presented autocorrelation with neighboring sites. The decrease in CVL prevalence may be associated to transmission stabilization, which could explain the lack of associations with dog-related variables. Further, spatial distribution of CVL is a poor evidence for design of transmission control measures but could be important in case of intensive parasite circulation or when the first autochthonous cases appear. For control success, sensitivity of diagnostic methods, political will and adequate material resources remain critical. Modeling of multiple variables will be required to identify factors that drive disease stabilization/destabilization."
Ecoepidemiological aspects of visceral leishmaniasis in an endemic area in the Steel Valley in Brazil: An ecological approach with spatial analysis,
"Studies of trypanosomiasis in the Luangwa valley, north-eastern Zambia","Background: The present study, conducted in Zambia's Luangwa valley where both animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) and human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) are endemic, combined the use of microscopy and molecular techniques to determine the presence of trypanosome species in cattle, goats and tsetse flies. Methods: This study was conducted between 2008 and 2010 in Petauke, Chama and Isoka districts, north-eastern Zambia. A total of 243 cattle, 36 goats and 546 tsetse flies, were examined for presence of trypanosome species using microscopy, PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Results: There was poor agreement among the test methods used for detection of trypanosomes species in animal blood and tsetse flies. Trypanosomes were observed in 6.1 % (95 % CI: 3.3-8.9 %) of the animals sampled by microscopy, 7.5 % (95 % CI: 4.4-10.6 %) by PCR and 18.6 % (95 % CI: 13.6-23.6 %) by PFR-LAMP. PFR-LAMP was more sensitive for detecting Trypanozoon than KIN-PCR. The highest occurrence of AAT was recorded in cattle from Petauke (58.7 %, 95 % CI: 44.7-72.7 %) while the lowest was from Isoka (5.4 %, 95 % CI: 0.8-10.0 %). Infection of both cattle and goats with Trypanosoma congolense and T. vivax was associated with clinical AAT. Conclusion: When selecting molecular techniques for AAT surveillance in endemic regions, the KIN-PCR and species-specific PCR may be recommended for screening animal or tsetse fly samples for T. congolense and T. vivax, respectively. On the other hand, species-specific PCR and/or LAMP might be of greater value in the screening of animal and human body fluids as well as tsetse fly samples for Trypanozoon."
Prevalence of Trypanosoma sp in cattle from Tanzania estimated by conventional PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP),"This study compared the prevalence of trypanosome infections estimated by PFR-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. One hundred forty eight cattle blood samples were collected from Robanda village, Mara region, Tanzania in April 2008. In conventional PCR, four sets of primers, specific for the detection of Trypanosoma sp., Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Trypanosoma vivax, and Trypanozoon, as well as a modified LAMP were used. Conventional PCR detected no infection or up to 8, 1, and 3 infections with Trypanosoma congolense savannah, Trypanozoon, and T. vivax, respectively, whereas LAMP detected additional 44 Trypanozoon positive cases. Our results clearly indicate that the prevalence of Trypanozoon spp. in cattle in Robanda village estimated by PFR-LAMP (30.4%) was significantly higher than the estimates by PCR assays (0.6-2%). As such, future studies should target epidemiological surveys of Trypanozoon and T. brucei rhodesiense infections in possible reservoir animals by LAMP to further elucidate the actual prevalence of these parasites."
Serological and infection statuses of dogs from a visceral leishmaniasis-endemic area,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the serological status of dogs living in a visceral leishmaniasis-endemic area and its correlation with the parasitological condition of the animals. METHODS: Canine humoral response was evaluated using the sera of 134 dogs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry to detect parasites in the skin, lymph node, and spleen of the animals. The specific antibodies investigated were IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IgE. RESULTS: According to the parasitological, laboratory, and clinical findings, the dogs were placed into one of four groups: asymptomatic with (AP+, n = 21) or without (AP-, n = 36) Leishmania tissue parasitism and symptomatic with (SP+, n = 52) or without (SP-, n = 25) parasitism. Higher IgG and IgE levels were positively correlated with the infection condition and parasite load, but not with the clinical status. In all groups, total IgG was the predominant antibody, which occurred at the expense of IgG2 instead of IgG1. Most of the infected dogs tested positive for IgG (SP+, 98.1%; AP+, 95.2%), whereas this was not observed with IgE (SP+, 80.8%; AP+, 71.2%). The most relevant finding was the high positivity of the uninfected dogs for Leishmania-specific IgG (SP-, 60.0%; AP-, 44.4%), IgE (SP-, 44.0%; AP-, 27.8%), IgG1 (SP-, 28.0%; AP-, 22.2%), and IgG2 antibodies (SP-, 56.0%; AP-, 41.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The serological status of dogs, as determined by any class or subclass of antibodies, did not accurately distinguish dogs infected with L. (L.) infantum chagasi from uninfected animals. The inaccuracy of the serological result may impair not only the diagnosis, but also epidemiological investigations and strategies for visceral leishmaniasis control. This complex serological scenario occurring in a visceral leishmaniasis-endemic area highlights the challenges associated with canine diagnosis and points out the difficulties experienced by veterinary clinicians and coordinators of control programs."
Bias due to methods of parasite detection when estimating prevalence of infection of Triatoma infestans by Trypanosoma cruzi,"The study aimed to quantify the bias from parasite detection methods in the estimation of the prevalence of infection of Triatoma infestans by Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease. Three common protocols that detect T. cruzi in a sample of 640 wild-caught T. infestans were compared: (1) the microscopic observation of insect fecal droplets, (2) a PCR protocol targeting mini-exon genes of T. cruzi (MeM-PCR), and (3) a PCR protocol targeting a satellite repeated unit of the parasite. Agreement among protocols was computed using Krippendorff K. The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of each protocol was estimated using latent class models. The PCR protocols were more sensitive (Se > 0.97) than microscopy (Se = 0.53) giving a prevalence of infection of 17-18%, twice as high as microscopy. Microscopy may not be as specific as PCR if Trypanosomatid-like organisms make up a high proportion of the sample. For small T. infestans, microscopy is not efficient, giving a prevalence of 1.5% when PCR techniques gave 10.7%. The PCR techniques were in agreement (K = 0.94) but not with microscopy (K never significant with both PCR techniques). Among the PCR protocols, the MeM-PCR was the most efficient (Se=1; Sp=1)."
"HEMATOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ALTERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TOXOPLASMOSIS IN DROMEDARIES (CAMELUS DROMEDARIUS) HABITATING IN CHOLISTAN DESERT OF BAHAWALPUR, PUNJAB, PAKISTAN","Toxoplasmosis is an important cause of reproductive failure in animals, resulting in socio economic losses all over the world. The aims of the current study was to investigate the seroprevalance of Toxoplasma gondii in Camelus dromedarius (Dromedary camels) and also to assess the hematological and biochemical alterations associated with T. gondii infection from February, 2015 to December, 2015. Blood samples were aseptically collected and were analyzed for T. gondii prevalence by direct agglutination test kits and hematobiochemical parameters by hematology analyzer. A total of 201 camels of different age were examined from 12 flocks in different Cholistan areas of Bahawalpur. Of 201 selected camels only 36 camels found seropositive of toxoplasmosis. The overall seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis was 17.91% in camels and the prevalence was found significantly (P<0.01) highest 31.25% in camels age group of >= 13 years and lowest 10.52% in age group of 9-12 years. Camels that suffered from toxoplasmosis (n=60) were subjected to hematological and biochemical analysis and matched with clinically healthy camels as control (n=60). The haematological analysis revealed a significant (P<0.05) reduction in the total RBC count, Hb concentration, HCT, PVC, MCH, MCHC, LYM, PLT and PDW in the affected camels. In addition, significant (P<0.05) increases in WBCs, MCV, RDW, NEUT, MPV, MXD, platelets and P-LCR were observed. The biochemical analysis revealed a highly significant reduction (P<0.05) in the sugar and AST level. Significant (P<0.05) increases in ALT, total bilirubin, blood urea, uric acid and blood cholesterol levels were detected in affected camels when compared with the controls. In conclusion, T. gondii was more common in older age group of camel; moreover toxoplasmosis greatly affected the hematobiochemical parameters of camel."
"African animal trypanosomosis (nagana) in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Strategic treatment of cattle on a farm in endemic area","African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) is caused by several species of the genus Trypanosoma, a parasitic protozoan infecting domestic and wild animals. One of the major effects of infection with pathogenic trypanosome is anaemia. Currently, the control policies for tsetse and trypanosomosis are less effective in South Africa. The only response was to block treat all infected herds and change the dip chemical to one which controls tsetse flies during severe outbreaks. This policy proved to be less effective as demonstrated by the current high level of trypanosome infections in cattle. Our objective was to study the impacts of AAT (nagana) on animal productivity by monitoring the health of cattle herds kept in tsetse and trypanosomosis endemic areas before and after an intervention that reduces the incidence of the disease. The study was conducted on a farm in northern KwaZulu-Natal which kept a commercial cattle herd. There was no history of any cattle treatment for trypanosome. All cattle were generally in poor health condition at the start of the study though the herd received regular anthelminthic treatment. A treatment strategy using two drugs, homidium bromide (ethidium) and homidium chloride (novidium), was implemented. Cattle were monitored regularly for 13 months for herd trypanosomosis prevalence (HP), herd average packed cell volume (H-PCV) and the percentage of the herd that was anaemic (HA). A total of six odour-baited H-traps were deployed where cattle grazed from January 2006 to August 2007 to monitor the tsetse population. Glossina brevipalpis Newstead and Glossina austeni Newstead were collected continuously for the entire study period. High trypanosomes HP (44%), low average H-PCV (29.5) and HA (24%) were rerecorded in the baseline survey. All cattle in the herd received their first treatment with ethidium bromide. Regular monthly sampling of cattle for the next 142 days showed a decline in HP of 2.2% - 2.8%. However, an HP of 20% was recorded by day 220 and the herd received the second treatment using novidium chloride. The HP dropped to 0.0% and HA to 0.0% by day 116 after the second treatment. The cow group was treated again by day 160 when the HP and HA were 27.3% and 11%, respectively. The same strategy was applied to the other two groups of weaners and the calves at the time when their HP reached 20%. Ethidium and novidium treatment protected cattle, that were under continuous tsetse and trypanosomosis challenge, for up to 6 months. Two to three treatments per year may be sufficient for extended protection. However, this strategy would need to be included into an integrated pest management approach combining vector control for it to be sustainable."
Distribution and pathogenicity of Trypanosoma cruzi isolated from peridomestic populations of Triatoma infestans and Triatoma guasayana from rural Western Argentina,"We assessed the distribution of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in peridomestic triatomines collected manually at a district-wide scale in rural villages around Olta, Western Argentina, and typed the isolated strains according to their pathogenicity to laboratory mice. Of 1623 triatomines examined, only 14 (0.9%) were infected with T. cruzi based on microscopical examination of feces. The prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 0.8% in Triatoma infestans, 2.3% in T. guasayana, and nil in T. garciabesi, T. platensis, and T. eratyrusiformis. Local transmission occurred in kitchens, store-rooms and goat corrals or nearby, though at very low levels. T. cruzi was detected by at least one parasitological method in 11 (79%) of 14 microscope-positive bugs. Hemoculture was the most sensitive method (67%) followed by culture of organ homogenates, histopathology or xenodiagnosis of inoculated suckling mice (55-58%), and culture of microscope-positive bug feces (46%). The evidence suggests that most of the isolated T. cruzi strains would be myotropic type III. Our study establishes for the first time that peridomestic, microscopepositive T. guasayana nymphs were actually infected with T. cruzi, and may be implicated as a putative secondary vector of T. cruzi in domestic or peridomestic sites."
GLOSSINA-FUSCA GROUP TSETSE AS VECTORS OF CATTLE TRYPANOSOMIASIS IN GABON AND ZAIRE,"1. The significance of Glossina fusca group tsetse flies as vectors of cattle trypanosomiasis was examined using biconical traps to survey tsetse populations at one site in Gabon and two sites in Zaire. 2. Mean trypanosome infection rates in G.tabaniformis Westwood over the study period ranged from a minimum of 8.9% at one site to a maximum of 17.7% at another. The mean infection rate in G. nashi Potts was 6.0%. 3. Up to 49% of bloodmeals of G.tabaniformis were from cattle. Trypanosome prevalence in cattle where G.tabaniformis appeared to be the main vector was 9.5% and 5.4% at the Mushie and OGAPROV ranches, respectively. 4. A highly significant positive correlation was found between tsetse challenge and trypanosome prevalence in N'Dama cattle across sites. Tsetse challenge was defined as the product of tsetse relative densities, trypanosome infection rates in the flies and the proportion of feeds taken by them from cattle. Thus, G.tabaniformis can be an important vector of pathogenic Trypanosoma species in cattle."
Risk profile for Leishmania infection in dogs coming from an area of visceral leishmaniasis reemergence,"Until the 1980s, visceral leishmaniasis was concentrated in poor rural areas of Brazil. The Vale do Rio Doce, located in the Southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, was an endemic area with high numbers of human and canine cases. Prophylactic measures adopted since the 1960s reduced the number of cases and the region became a 'controlled endemic' area. In the early 1990s, however, the program was interrupted, and the human disease reemerged in 2008. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence and the risk profile of infection of dogs with Leishmania spp in this reemergence area of visceral leishmaniasis. Among a population of approximately 280,000 people, a total of 3835 dog owners were interviewed about socioeconomic conditions, housing, peridomicile features, and their dogs' characteristics and behavior. Blood samples were collected from 5822 dogs of an estimated canine population of 20,000 and anti-Leishmaniasis antibodies were identified using Dual-Path Platform and ELISA. We observed that 1282 of the 5822 dogs were seropositive for the protozoan indicating a seroprevalence of 22%. The risk factors associated with Leishmania infection in dogs were: non-paved backyard (OR 1.4; 95%CI 1.2-1.7); the presence of dry leaves and decaying fruit in the backyard (OR 1.3; 95%CI 1.1-1.5); medium-sized (OR 1.3; 95% 1.1-1.5) or big-sized dogs (OR 1.8; 95%CI 1.5-2.3); short-haired dogs (OR 1.8; 95%CI 1.5-2.1); dogs that slept in the backyard (OR 2.6; 95%CI 1.8-3.6) or in the balcony (OR 1.6; 95%CI 1.1-2.3); and history of canine visceral leishmaniasis in the household (OR 1.3; 95%CI 1.1-1.5). Our results suggest a strong reemergence of canine visceral leishmaniasis after the discontinuation of the control programs. Also, the observed risk factors reinforce the role of health education and environmental management measures to the effective control of the disease."
"Epidemiology of canine leishmaniasis in southern Bahia, Brazil","Leishmaniosis is a zoonosis caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. American cutaneous leishmaniosis (ACL) is mainly caused by the species L. amazonensis and L braziliensis, and American visceral leishmaniosis (AVL) is caused by L infantum chagasi. In addition to their proven roles as reservoirs of AVL, dogs are also suspected by researchers to be reservoirs of ACL due to reports of this infection in domestic environments and of infected dogs in endemic areas. The aim of this study was to detect Leishmania sp. infection in dogs from Vila Operaria, Buerarema, Bahia, using parasitological tests, indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore, this study also aimed to identify risk factors associated with illness in dogs in this locality by conducting an epidemiological survey. For this purpose, 292 dogs were clinically evaluated for the presence of skin lesions, and the dogs that showed these changes were submitted to scarification injury to enable preparation of slides for microscopic study of amastigotes. Subsequently, the dogs underwent blood sampling for serological (IFA) and molecular (PCR) tests. Additionally, the owners of the dogs answered an epidemiological questionnaire to facilitate the identification of risk factors for exposure of dogs to pathogens of ACL Of the 292 dogs studied, 13 (4.5%) had lesions suggestive of ACL, but with a negative parasitological examination and 147(50.3%) were seropositive according to the IFA. Of the 273 dogs studied using PCR test, 10(3.66%) were positive for L. braziliensis, and all samples were negative for L infantum chagasi. Wastelands in the peridomicile and the presence of light in the household were risk factors associated with ACL The results show that Vila Operaria has asymptomatic dogs with ACL and that the detection sensitivity of the IFA was higher than that of PCR for the infected dogs.

Performance of Leishmania PFR1 recombinant antigen in serological diagnosis of asymptomatic canine leishmaniosis by ELISA,"Background: Leishmania infantum is a protozoan parasite transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies that causes life-threatening disease in humans and dogs. The dog is the primary reservoir of the parasite and early diagnosis of canine leishmaniosis is crucial at the clinical and epidemiological level. The currently available serological tests for CanL diagnostic show limitations therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of an indirect antibody ELISA based on the Leishmania infantum recombinant antigen PFR1 in asymptomatically infected dogs. One hundred fifty-six dogs including Leishmania-free experimental Beagles and pet dogs from England, Scotland and Leishmania-endemic Murcia in Spain, were tested with the assay. The later were also tested with two commercial L. infantum crude antigen ELISAs (INgezim and Civtest, respectively) and a real-time kinetoplast PCR test. Results: Anti-PFR1 antibodies were detected in the four groups of dogs, and the mean log-transformed optical density (OD) values were lowest in Beagles and in dogs from England and highest among dogs from Murcia (p < 0.05). Using the highest OD in beagles as the PFR1 ELISA cut-off point, the estimated seroprevalence was 27% (14-40%) in dogs from Murcia, 4% (0-9%) in dogs from Scotland and 3% (0-8%) in dogs from England (p < 0.05). Seroprevalence in dogs from Murcia according to the INgezim and Civtest ELISAs were 24% (12-37%) and 31% (18-45%), respectively, whilst the prevalence of infection based on PCR in these dogs was 73% (60-86). The percentages of PFR1-positive dogs that tested negative on the INgezim and Civtest ELISAs were 30% and 35%, respectively, and all of them tested positive on the PCR test. Relative to the PCR, the specificity, sensitivity and area under the ROC curve of the PFR1 ELISA were 100%, 36% and 0.74 (0.63-0.86), respectively. Conclusions: The ability shown by the PFR1 ELISA to detect infected dogs that go undetected by the crude antigen ELISAs is clinically and epidemiologically useful and PFR1 could be considered a candidate for a multi-antigen-based immunoassay for early detection of L. infantum infected dogs."
"Bovine trypanosomosis and its fly vectors in three selected settlement areas of Hawa-Gelan district, western Ethiopia","A cross-sectional study aimed at investigating the species diversity of fly vectors and estimating the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis was carried out from October 2009 to May 2010 in selected settlement areas of the Hawa-Gelan district in the western Wollega zone of Ethiopia. Standard methods of sampling and identification were employed for both entomological and parasitological examination. Three species of the genus Glossina (Glossina pallidipes, Glossina morsitans submorsitans and Glossina fuscipes) and two genera of biting flies (Stomoxys and Tabanus) were caught and identified. The overall apparent density of Glossina species caught was 10.5 flies per trap per day, with a higher proportion of female flies (57.2%). Out of a total 389 cattle examined, 42 (10.8%; 95% CI: 7.89% - 14.3%) were found infected with trypanosomes. Three trypanosome species were detected in the study area, namely Trypanosoma congolense (54.8%), Trypanosoma brucei (23.8%) and Trypanosoma vivax (21.4%). The prevalence of trypanosomosis was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher in cattle with poor body condition. There was an association between mean packed cell volume (PCV) and the occurrence of parasitaemia (chi(2) = 49.5, p < 0.05). About 95.2% of cattle that were positive for trypanosomes had a PCV less than the lower limit for cattle. Considering the current result, bovine trypanosomosis seems to be a serious constraint for agricultural activities in the settlement areas of the Hawa-Gelan district and seems to be associated with the presence of Glossina species. Therefore, application of control methods through community involvement to reduce the Glossina species infestation level is likely to increase animal productivity."
Preliminary study on investigation of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in endemic foci of Ethiopia by detecting Leishmania infections in rodents,"Objective: To investigate the zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) by identification of the most probable reservoir hosts using parasite isolation and analysis of a possible transmission dynamics of the disease in extra-domestic agricultural fields and rural villages. Methods: Rodents were collected from selected study sites in kala-azar endemic areas based on information for localities of kala-azar cases for screening of Leishmania infections using parasitological, serological and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from March, 2013 to January, 2014. Ketamine (Clorketam Veterinary) was used to anaesthesize the rodents according the prescribed dosage (average 2 mg/kg for intra-venous route). The blood obtained using sterile needle was dropped into sterile filter paper and allowed to air dry before sealing in plastic bags. The tissues from liver, spleen and skin were macerated in Locke's solution before transferring them into NNN medium. Blood and touch smears of liver, spleen, skin and bone marrow were prepared for fixing using methanol and staining by Giemsa stain for microscopy. These tissues were also used for DNA extractions and PCR amplification of Leishmania infection. Results: A total of 335 rodents (13 species) were analyzed by sampling internal organs. The infection rate by PCR was 11.1% (6/54) for Arvicanthis nilothicits compared to 17.6% (3/17) and 12.5% (2/16) for Acomys cahirinus and Tarera (G) robustus respectively. Almost all the infections were found from bone marrow samples (8/48 or 16.7%) compared with 1/91(1.1%) liver, 2/87(2.2%) spleen and 0/87 (0%) skin. In all study sites with past human VL cases, rodents and proved vectors shared similar habitats. Conclusions: Leishmania donovani might circulate among different species of rodents in kala-azar endemic lowlands and valleys of Ethiopia by Phlebotomus orienialis and Phlebotomus martini. Detailed studies to substantiate the preliminary data on the possible role of these rodents are urgently needed."
A cross-sectional study of Leishmania spp. infection in clinically healthy dogs with polymerase chain reaction and serology in Greece,"A total of 73 clinically healthy hunting dogs, experiencing an outdoor lifestyle and originating from an area where canine leishmaniasis is endemic, were included in the study. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for Leishmania spp. were done on bone marrow and serum samples, respectively, obtained from all 73 dogs, just before the beginning of the sandfly season. PCR was found positive in 46/73 (63%) whereas, TEAT only in 9/73 (12.3%) of the dogs. The prevalence and the incidence of Leishmania infection by PCR were 61.9 and 47.1%, respectively. No association was found between the breed, age, sex, length of hair coat of the dog, urban or rural life and the presence of ample vegetation and water collections in the proximity of their living quarters, and the result of PCR. These findings clearly demonstrate that most of the dogs residing areas where leishmaniasis is endemic become infected but usually remain seronegative. Serological screening of the general canine population in these areas may result in an underestimation of the true prevalence of the infection rate. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

"Survey of blood parasites in two forest owls, Northern Saw-whet Owls and Flammulated Owls, of western North America","Except for a few studies in the eastern United States, little has been published on hemoparasites in owls. We surveyed the blood parasites of 108 Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) and 24 Flammulated Owls (Otus flammeolus) in Idaho during autumn migration in 1999 and 2000. We also surveyed 15 Flammulated Owls (FLOW) during breeding season in Utah from 2000. Leucocytozoon ziemanni, Haemoproteus syrnii, Haemoproteus noctuae, and Trypanosoma avium were identified. The overall prevalence of infection was 53% (78/147) and for the combined species, prevalences of Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Trypanosoma species were 20%, 39%, and 4%, respectively. Northern Saw-whet Owls (NSWO) had an overall prevalence of 51% (55/108), with prevalences of 6%, 47%, and 4% by hemoparasite genus, respectively. Flammulated Owls had an overall prevalence of 59% (23/39), with prevalences of 56%, 18%, and 5% by genus, respectively. This study provides baseline hematozoa information for two boreal owl species."
"Periurban Trypanosoma cruzi-infected Triatoma infestans, Arequipa, Peru","In Arequipa, Peru, vectorborne transmission of Chagas disease by Triatoma infestans has become an urban problem. We conducted an entomologic survey in a periurban community of Arequipa to identify risk factors for triatomine infestation and determinants of vector population densities. Of 374 households surveyed, triatomines were collected from 194 (52%), and Trypanosoma cruzi-carrying triatomines were collected from 72 (19.3%). Guinea pig pens were more likely than other animal enclosures to be infested and harbored 2.38x as many triatomines. Stacked brick and adobe enclosures were more likely to have triatomines, while wire mesh enclosures were protected against infestation. In human dwellings, only fully stuccoed rooms were protected against infestation. Spatially, households with triatomines were scattered, while households with T. cruzi-infected triatomines were clustered. Keeping small animals in wire mesh cages could facilitate control of T. infestans in this densely populated urban environment."
Small mammals as hosts of Leishmania spp. in a highly endemic area for zoonotic leishmaniasis in north-eastern Brazil,"Leishmania parasites cause leishmaniasis in humans and animals worldwide. These parasites are transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, which become infected upon feeding on an infected mammalian host. We assessed the occurrence of Leishmania infection in small mammals in an area of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis endemicity. A total of 180 small mammals were trapped in 2003 and 2006 in a rural area in north-eastern Brazil. Spleen and skin samples from these animals were assessed by two PCR protocols, one targeting Leishmania (Viannia) spp. and other Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. Additionally, serum samples were tested by an immunochromatographic test with rK39 as antigen. Overall, 23.2 (38/164) of the animals were positive to L. (V.) spp. and 8.8 (14/160) to L. (L.) infantum). Five animals of four species (Didelphis albiventris, Nectomys squamipes, Rattus rattus and Holochilus sciureus) were positive by both PCR protocols, an overall co-infection rate of 2.5. By serology, 5 (7/139) of the animals were positive, but all of them were PCR-negative. An isolate obtained from a water rat (N. squamipes) was characterized as L. (V.) braziliensis (zymodeme Z-74). This study reinforces the involvement of different small mammals (e.g., N. squamipes, R. rattus and H. scieurus) in the transmission cycles of L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (L.) infantum in north-eastern Brazil. The finding of L. (V.) braziliensis infection in black rats suggests a rapid process of adaptation of a New World Leishmania species to an Old World rodent and raises interesting questions regarding the co-evolution of these parasites and their vertebrate hosts."
"Investigation of Chagas disease in four periurban areas in northeastern Brazil: epidemiologic survey in man, vectors, non-human hosts and reservoirs","Chagas disease was investigated in four periurban areas of Ceara state, northeastern Brazil, through serological, parasitological and molecular methods in humans, reservoirs and vectors. A cross-sectional survey revealed a seroprevalence rate of 1.2% (13/1076 residents, six also proving positive through PCR). Trypanosoma cruzi infection was not detected in children under 10 years old. Triatoma pseudomaculata prevailed in the peridomiciles: 63 specimens, 69% (34/49) infected with trypanosomatids. Rhodnius nasutus was captured in Copernicia prunifera palm trees (n = 280; 25.0% infected with trypanosomatids) and inside dwellings (n = 8, all uninfected). Trypanosoma cruzi seropositive reservoirs, represented by Didelphis albiventris (n = 27), Rattus rattus (n = 24), Thrichomys laurentius (n = 2), Mus musculus (n = 1) and Monodelphis domestica (n = 1), were identified. Among domestic dogs (n = 96) seroprevalence reached 21.9%. Miniexon multiplex PCR assays characterized TcI in triatomines. Both TcI and TcII were detected in wild mammal hosts. We conclude that Trypanosoma cruzi circulates within a domestic zoonotic cycle, requiring continuous surveillance. Insecticide application to domiciles does not appear to prevent continuous reintroduction of wild triatomine specimens, presenting a challenge to authorities involved in Chagas disease control.

Seroprevalence and spatial distribution of canine leishmaniasis in an endemic region in Brazil: how has the situation changed after 10 years?,"Introduction: Herein, we assessed the seroprevalence and spatial distribution of Leishmania infantum in dogs in Garanhuns, Northeastern Brazil. Methods: Sera samples (n = 242) were analyzed using an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The spatial distribution of dogs seropositive for anti- Leishmania infantum antibodies was evaluated using kernel density estimation. Results: A total of 2.4% (6/242) of the animals were seropositive for anti- Leishmania infantum antibodies. The kernel map showed their distribution to be heterogeneous over the city, with a hotspot in the northeastern region. Conclusions: The reported data illustrate the circulation of parasites of the genus Leishmania in a canine population."
"Persistence of phlebotomine Leishmania vectors in urban sites of Catania (Sicily, Italy)","Background: Pioneering research on ""Mediterranean Kala-Azar"" carried out by Adler and Theodor early in the past century (similar to 1930s) had identified Catania city (Sicily) as a major focus of the disease nowadays known as zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Despite the fact that disease in both humans and dogs has continued to be highly prevalent in the Catania province up to the present times, research on Leishmania vectors in this urban focus dates back to that distant period. This study aimed to evaluate the persistence and current composition of the sand fly fauna in urban environments of Catania in recent years, 2006 and 2013. Methods: In 2006 fifty-one suitable collecting sites were identified within 44 sub-units of a grid drawn to include the urban Catania area. In 2013 the survey was restricted to four of the most productive and representative sites resulting from the 2006 survey. In both periods 3 collections per month were performed using standard sticky traps set for 3 days in wall holes/cavities along public roads, from the end of April through December. Results: 43/51 sites (84.3%) were found positive for sand flies. The 2006 collections accounted for a total of 4341 specimens including six species. Among competent Leishmania vector species, P. perniciosus was the most prevalent (36.5%) being identified in all sand fly-positive sites, with significant abundance in those of the old city centre. Other species of interest were P. sergenti (2.5%) and P. neglectus (1.5%). The 2013 survey produced 1130 sand flies, of which 39.5% were P. perniciosus, 1.6% P. sergenti and 0.7% P. neglectus. A search for Leishmania DNA in a small sample of 72 P. perniciosus females revealed 11% infection prevalence. Conclusions: Our findings from an old urban focus of leishmaniasis demonstrate that phlebotomine sand flies have adapted fairly well to the drastic environmental changes that have occurred in cities of the Western world in the past century and still represent a potential risk for Leishmania transmission."
"Determination of the prevalence of African trypanosome species in indigenous dogs of Mambwe district, eastern Zambia, by loop-mediated isothermal amplification","Background: Dogs have been implicated to serve as links for parasite exchange between livestock and humans and remain an important source of emerging and re-emerging diseases including trypanosome infections. Yet, canine African trypanosomosis (CAT), particularly in indigenous dogs (mongrel breed) remains under-reported in literature. This study evaluated the performance of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in detecting trypanosomes in blood from indigenous dogs of tsetse-infested Mambwe district in eastern Zambia. Methods: A cross sectional survey of CAT was conducted within 5 chiefdoms (Msoro, Kakumbi, Munkanya, Nsefu, Malama) of Mambwe district, eastern Zambia, during October 2012. Blood samples from 237 indigenous hunting dogs were collected and screened by microscopy and LAMP. Results: Of the 237 dogs screened for CAT, 14 tested positive by microscopy (5.9%; 95% CI: 2.9 - 8.9%), all of which also tested positive by LAMP. In addition, LAMP detected 6 additional CAT cases, bringing the total cases detected by LAMP to 20 (8.4%; 95% CI: 4.9 - 12.0%). Irrespective of the detection method used, CAT was only recorded from 3 chiefdoms (Munkanya, Nsefu, Malama) out of the 5. According to LAMP, these infections were caused by Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma brucei brucei and the zoonotic Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Although these CAT cases generally did not manifest clinical illness, an association was observed between infection with Trypanosoma brucei subspecies and occurrence of corneal opacity. Conclusions: This communication reports for the first time the occurrence of CAT in indigenous Zambian dogs. Our study indicates that LAMP is a potential diagnostic tool for trypanosome detection in animals. LAMP was more sensitive than microscopy and was further capable of distinguishing the closely related T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense. In view of the sporadic cases of re-emerging HAT being reported within the Luangwa valley, detection of the human serum resistant associated (SRA) gene in trypanosomes from mongrels is intriguing and indicative of the risk of contracting HAT by local communities and tourists in Mambwe district. Consequently, there is a need for continuous trypanosome surveillances in animals, humans and tsetse flies using sensitive and specific tests such as LAMP."
"Type-specific PCR assays for Babesia bovis msa-1 genotypes in Asia: Revisiting the genetic diversity in Sri Lanka, Mongolia, and Vietnam","Babesia bovis is the most virulent Babesia organism, resulting in a high mortality rate in cattle. The genetic diversity of B. bovis merozoite surface antigens (MSAs), such as MSA-1, MSA-2b, and MSA-2c, might be linked to altered immune profiles in the host animals. The present study aimed to develop type-specific PCR assays for Asian msa-1 genotypes, thereby re-analyzing the genetic diversity of msa-1 in Sri Lanka, Mongolia, and Vietnam. Specific primers were designed for nine Asian msa-1 genotypes, which had been detected based on the phylogeny constructed using msa-1 gene sequences retrieved from the GenBank database. Specificity of the type-specific PCR assays was confirmed using plasmids containing the inserts of msa-1 gene fragments that represent Asian genotypes. Furthermore, no amplicons were observed by these PCR assays when DNA samples of Babesia bigemina, Babesia ovata, Theileria annulata, Theileria orientalis, Trypanosoma evansi, Trypanosoma theileri, Anaplasma marginale, and Anaplasma bovis, and non-infected bovine blood were analyzed. In total, 109 B. bovis-positive blood DNA samples sourced from Sri Lanka (44 cattle), Mongolia (26 cattle), and Vietnam (23 cattle and 16 water buffaloes) were then screened by the type-specific PCR assays. The sequences derived from all of the PCR amplicons were phylogenetically analyzed. Out of 109 DNA samples, 23 (20 from cattle and 3 from water buffaloes) were positive for at least one genotype. In agreement with previous studies, five and four different genotypes were detected among the DNA samples from Sri Lanka and Vietnam, respectively. In contrast, four genotypes, including three novel genotypes, were detected from Mongolia. Five DNA samples were found to be co-infected with multiple genotypes. The sequences of the PCR amplicons clustered phylogenetically within the corresponding clades. These findings indicated that the type-specific PCR assays described herein are useful for the determination of genotypic diversity of the B. bovis msa-1 gene in Asia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Wild Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) as Sentinels of Parasitic Diseases in the Province of Soria, Northern Spain","Four hundred red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were examined for ecto- (arthropods) and endoparasites (Leishmania spp., Trichinella spp., and intestinal parasites). Different species of flea (total prevalence, 40.50%), tick (16.25%), mite (7.25%), and fly (1.50%) were identified. The most prevalent flea was Pulex irritans (found on 29% of the foxes); the most prevalent tick, mite, and fly were Ixodes canisuga (on 5%), Sarcoptes scabiei (on 5.25%), and Hippobosca equina (on 1%), respectively. The endoparasites identified included Leishmania spp. (found in 12% of the foxes), Trichinella spp. (in 15.5%, with T. britovi the most prevalent species in 15.25%), Cestoda (in 72.75%, with Mesocestoides spp. the most prevalent in 69.50%), and intestinal ascarids (in 73.25%, with Ancylostoma caninum the most prevalent in 12.50%). No animal was free of parasites. The present results suggest that foxes can act as sentinels of diseases transmitted by ecto- and endoparasites."
Honey bee pathogens in Ghana and the presence of contaminated beeswax,"A nationwide survey was performed to study the distribution of parasites, pathogens and pesticides in managed honey bee populations in Ghana. When 45 colonies were sampled and inspected for signs of disease, Varroa destructor was the most prevalent parasite (89%; n = 40), all mites corresponding to the Korean haplotype of this pathogen. Aethina tumida (42%; n = 19) and Braula coeca (7%; n = 3) were also detected, as were Melissococcus plutonius and trypanosomatids (7%). By contrast, Nosema spp., Acarapis spp., Ascosphaera apis and Paenibacillus larvae were not detected by molecular screening. Amitraz was the most widely distributed pesticide (75%; n = 23) followed by coumaphos (47%; n = 15), chlorpyrifos (34%; n = 15) and fluvalinate (31%; n = 10). This survey lays the groundwork for further monitoring of honey bee populations in Ghana."
"Antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania spp. in domestic cats from Luanda, Angola","Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania spp. are zoonotic protozoa of importance to animal and public health. The present study aimed to assess for the first time the seroprevalence of these zoonotic parasites in a domestic feline population living in Luanda, Angola. One hundred and two cats were sampled at a veterinary medical centre, from May 2014 to February 2016. The age of the cats ranged from 2.5 to 143 months (median: 12 months; interquartile range: 7.5-24). Serum samples were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to T. gondii at two-fold dilutions of 1:20 to 1:2560 with a modified agglutination test (MAT) commercial kit. The direct agglutination test (DAT) for titration of IgG antibodies specific to Leishmania spp. used a standard freeze-dried antigen at a concentration of 5 x 10(7) promastigotes per milliliter, following a predefined protocol. Two-fold dilution series ranging from 1:25 to 1:800 were tested, with a cut-off titre of 100 chosen for seropositivity. Four out of 102 cats (3.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-9.7) had antibodies to T. gondii: one had a titer of 20, one a titer of 160, and two had a titer >= 2560. No cat (0.0%; CI: 0.0-3.5) was found seropositive for Leishmania spp. A statistically significant difference was found between T. gondii seroprevalence and Leishmania spp. seroprevalence (p = 0.043). The odds of a cat being seropositive to T. gondii increased by an average factor of 1.58 for each 1-year increase in age (p = 0.003). The sampled cats were well-cared animals and may not represent the overall feline population of Angola at the national and city levels. The fact that only 12 out of the 102 sampled cats ate or had access to raw or undercooked meat and/or viscera may have reduced the likelihood of finding seropositive results. Under these circumstances, additional studies, including a larger number of cats, are necessary for a more comprehensive assessment of the zoonotic risk posed by these animals in Angola."
Prevalence of antibodies to Leishmania infantum and Toxoplasma gondii in horses from the north of Portugal,"Background: Leishmania infantum and Toxoplasma gondii are protozoa with zoonotic and economic importance. Prevalences of antibodies to these agents were assessed in 173 horses from the north of Portugal. Findings: Antibodies to L. infantum were detected by the direct agglutination test (DAT); seven (4.0%) horses were seropositive with DAT titres of 200 (n = 5), 800 (n = 1) and >= 1600 (n = 1). Antibodies to T. gondii were assayed by the modified agglutination test (MAT); 23 (13.3%) horses were seropositive with MAT titres of 20 (n = 13), 40 (n = 5), 80 (n = 3) and >= 160 (n = 2). No statistical differences were found among equine categories of gender (female, male and gelding), age (1.5-6, 7-12 and 13-30 years), type of housing (indoors and mixed/outdoors), ability (recreation, farming and sports) and clinical status (apparently healthy and sick) for both agents. Conclusions: Horses are exposed to and may be infected with L. infantum and T. gondii in the north of Portugal."

"Seroprevalence and risk factors associated with visceral leishmaniasis in dogs in Jaciara, State of Mato Grosso","Introduction: Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected disease. Jaciara, State of Mato Grosso has the most cases. This study aimed to determine the risk factors and seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis in urban and rural areas. Methods: This cross-sectional study of domestic dogs used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence test. Results: The prevalence was 54.7% among 345 analyzed samples. Short coat, age of 1-6 years, and living less than 100m from vegetation posed the highest infection risks. Conclusions: Certain dog behaviors and characteristics, and their correlation with environmental conditions, were relevant in the high prevalence of canine leishmaniasis in Jaciara."
Patterns of parasite prevalence and individual infection in yellow-bellied marmots,"Patterns of infection and prevalence result from complex interactions between hosts and parasites, the effects of which are likely to vary by species. We investigated the effects of age, sex and season on the likelihood of individual infection, and the effects of host population size, sex ratio and age structure on parasite prevalence. We capitalized on data from a long-term study of yellow-bellied marmots Marmota flaviventris potentially infected with fecal-orally transmitted intestinal parasites (Ascaris sp., Eimeria spp. and Entamoeba sp.), ectoparasitic fleas Thrassis stanfordi, and a flea- and louse-transmitted blood parasite Trypanosoma lewisi. Patterns of individual- and group-level infection varied widely by parasite. Yearlings were more likely to be infected with Tr.lewisi and Ascaris. Yearlings were also slightly more likely than adults to have Eimeria, but female yearlings had higher infection levels than female adults, while male yearlings had lower infection levels than male adults. Entamoeba infection decreased as the season progressed. Adults and males were more likely to be infected with Th.stanfordi. Ascaris prevalence increased with colony size. There were no significant relationships between colony size and prevalence of Entamoeba, Tr.lewisi, Eimeria or Thrassis. There was a small, but significant positive correlation between male-biased sex ratio and prevalence of fleas. The host population's age structure affected the prevalence of infection of Ascaris and Eimeria. Overall intestinal parasite diversity increased with colony size. Taken together, our results show a great deal of variation in the likelihood of individual infection and patterns of parasite prevalence in marmots."
Seroprevalence of Antibodies Against the Excreted Antigen Superoxide Dismutase by Trypanosoma Cruzi in Dogs From the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico),"Numerous studies have shown the role of dogs as a reservoir for the American trypanosomiasis, as the bridge connecting sylvatic and peridomestic cycles. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of American trypanosomiasis in the dog population (630 sera) from seven localities in the Yucatan Peninsula (city of Merida and the towns of Molas, Playa del Carmen, Akumal, Xcalacoop, Xcalac and Xahuachol). These data are key for developing control measures for the disease. The sera were analysed to detect antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi, using Fe-SOD excreted as the antigenic fraction by ELISA and Western blot as confirmation. The total prevalence found in the Yucatan Peninsula was some 14.76%, with 10.74% in the state of Yucatan (city of Merida, towns of Molas and Xcalacoop) and 21.34% in the state of Quintana Roo (towns of Playa del Carmen, Akumal, Xcalac and Xahuachol). However, a more thorough epidemiological study of the dog population, both wild and urban, in the Yucatan Peninsula will be required to design a control strategy for these diseases, paying particular attention to the population affected and even broadening the study to other Mexican states as well as neighbouring countries. These results again confirm that iron-superoxide dismutase excreted by T.cruzi constitutes a good source of antigen for serodiagnosis in epidemiological studies."
Leishmania spp. Epidemiology of Canine Leishmaniasis in the Yucatan Peninsula,"Canine Leishmaniasis is widespread in various Mexican states, where different species of Leishmania have been isolated from dogs. In the present study, we describe the detection of L. braziliensis, L. infantum, and L. mexicana in serum of dogs from the states of Yucatan and Quintana Roo in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico). A total of 412 sera were analyzed by ELISA using the total extract of the parasite and the iron superoxide dismutase excreted by different trypanosomatids as antigens. We found the prevalence of L. braziliensis to be 7.52%, L. infantum to be 6.07%, and L. mexicana to be 20.63%, in the dog population studied. The results obtained with ELISA using iron superoxide dismutase as the antigen were confirmed by western blot analysis with its greater sensitivity, and the agreement between the two techniques was very high."
Antibody-ELISA seroprevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in the Eastern Province of Zambia,"A longitudinal study was conducted over a I-year period in six selected villages in Petauke and Katete districts in the Eastern Province of Zambia. Starting in November 1997, 50 animals were sampled at random at each village every 2 months. The parasitological prevalence of trypanosomosis was determined by the haematocrit centrifugation buffy-coat technique, supplemented with thick and thin Giemsa-stained blood films. Serum samples also were collected for anti-trypanosomal antibody determination by indirect, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Parasitological prevalence was highly variable between villages and between visits (range: 0-28.6%; median: 3.1%). Seroprevalence was also variable between villages (range: 0-80.8%; median: 50%), but was less variable between visits. Average annual parasitological prevalence and average annual seroprevalence for each village were highly correlated [R-2 (adjusted for d.f.) = 0.89, p < 0.01]. Seroprevalence measured on any single visit to a study village was better than parasitological prevalence as a predictor of average annual parasitological prevalence. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B,V.

Occurrence of synanthropic triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in the Federal District of Brazil,"Introduction: Entomological surveillance of Chagas disease in the Federal District of Brazil (DF), has recorded the following triatomine species: Panstrongylus megistus, P. geniculatus, P. diasi, Rhodnius neglectus, Triatoma pseudomaculata, and T. sordida. We aimed to analyze the spatial and temporal occurrence of triatomine species collected in DF, and their indices of natural infection with trypanosomes. Methods: The Health State Secretariat of DF recorded triatomines between 2002 and 2010 in 20 administrative regions. This retrospective analysis considered the number of adults and nymphs of each species collected and infected in both intradomicile and peridomicile. Results: A total of 754 triatomines were collected in 252 reported domiciles. Panstrongylus megistus was the most frequent species (65%), followed by T. pseudomaculata (14%). Of the 309 examined insects, only 3 (1%) specimens of P. megistus were infected with flagellates morphologically similar to Trypanosoma cruzi. The spatial occurrence indicated a higher diversity of triatomines and frequency of T. sordida in rural areas. Moreover, there was a predominance of P. megistus in urban areas. The number of records of P. megistus in the rainy season was two times higher than that during the dry season. The largest number of triatomines was collected in November. Conclusions: The presence of P. megistus specimens infected with trypanosomes in domiciles, shows the potential risk of human infection in DF. Thus, it is essential to continue entomological surveillance, intensifying it in the rainy season and in regions of greater occurrence."
Direct molecular identification of Trypanosoma cruzi Discrete Typing Units in domestic and peridomestic Triatoma infestans and Triatoma sordida from the Argentine Chaco,"We assessed the distribution of Trypanosoma cruzi Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in domestic and peridomestic Triatoma infestans and Triatoma sordida specimens collected in a well-defined rural area in Pampa del Indio, northeastern Argentina. Microscopically-positive bugs were randomly selected with a multi-level sampling design, and DTUs were identified using direct PCR strategies. TcVI predominated in 61% of 69 T. infestans and in 56% of 9 T. sordida. TcV was the secondary DTU in T. infestans (16%) and was found in 1 T. sordida specimen (11%). Three T. sordida (33%) were found infected with TcI, a DTU also identified in local Didelphis albiventris opossums. Mixed DTU infections occurred rarely (5%) and were detected both directly from the bugs' rectal ampoule and parasite cultures. The identified DTUs and bug collection sites of T. infestans were significantly associated. Bugs infected with TcV were almost exclusively captured in domiciles whereas those with TcVI were found similarly in domiciles and peridomiciles. All mixed infections occurred in domiciles. TcV-infected bugs fed more often on humans than on dogs, whereas TcVI-infected bugs showed the reverse pattern. T. sordida is a probable sylvatic vector of TcI linked to D. albiventris, and could represent a secondary vector of TcVI and TcV in the domestic/peridomestic cycle."
Epidemiological risk for Trypanosoma cruzi transmission by species of Phyllosoma complex in the occidental part of Mexico,"Domestic and peridomestic triatomine populations were collected in three rural Mexican communities of Jalisco, Nayarit and Zacatecas states. Triatoma longipennis and T. picturata (Phyllosoma complex) were the principal Species unequally distributed in the villages: T. longipennis was the main species in two communities and T. picturata in the third one. Peridomestic infestation and colonization indexes were remarkably high ranging from 26.1% to 50% and from 58.3% to 85.7%, respectively. Moreover, domestic (indoor) infestation was observed in only one of the Communities infested by T longipennis. The preliminary study of temporal variation indicates increasing trend of the triatomine Population and infestation rates during the dry season. Triatomine infection rates ranged from 41.2% to 60.2% and all the flagellate isolates were assigned to T. cruzi l. The majority of the dwellings were built with modern building materials and the sanitary conditions were generally good. High peridomestic infestations must be considered as a risk factor of Chagas disease transmission and further Studies are needed to better understand the peridomestic conditions favoring the establishment of the triatomines. The contribution of such Study to enlarger knowledge of epidemiological features of Chagas disease in Mexico is considered. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Molecular identification of trypanosome species in trypanotolerant cattle from the south of Gabon,"The aim of this study was to provide information on trypanosome species infecting trypanotolerant cattle from southern Gabon. The study was conducted on 224 trypanotolerant cattle from three regions located in southern Gabon, using ITS1 primer-based PCR. Seventy-two (32%) N'dama cattle were found polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive with trypanosomes. The overall prevalence of trypanosomosis was 57% (63/110), 4% (4/100), and 36% (5/14) in the Gala section of the Nyanga ranch, the Miyama ranch, and Ossiele, respectively. Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax were identified. In Gala section and Ossiele, T. congolense and T. vivax were found. In the Miyama ranch, only T. vivax was identified. Mixed infections were also found. The forest (9%) and savannah (63%) subgroups of T. congolense were identified. The presence of the two subgroups was detected in 16 out of 56 cattle (29%). T. congolense and T. vivax would appear to be the main agents responsible for bovine trypanosomosis in southern Gabon. Although trypanotolerant, N'dama cattle may serve as a reservoir, and this should be further studied. On the other hand, these trypanotolerant cattle can be reared in such tsetse infested areas, which gives them an advantage compared to other trypanosensitive breeds, and this shows that they represent a key factor in biodiversity which has to be promoted."
Comparative evaluation of the antibody-detection ELISA technique using microplates precoated with denatured crude antigens from Trypanosoma congolense or Trypanosoma vivax,"Two FAO/IAEA indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which use microplates precoated with denatured crude Trypanosoma congolense or Trypanosoma vivax antigen for detecting anti-trypanosomal antibodies in bovine sera, were evaluated for their sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values, using 320 Ugandan field samples (known negative sera, n = 80; known positive sera, n = 80; cattle herds where control of tsetse and trypanosomosis was practised, n = 80; and cattle herds where there was no such control, n = 80). Cut-off points of 30% and 25% positivity were determined for the T. congolense and T. vivax assays, respectively, using a modified ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis. The T. congolense assay had estimated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 63.7% and 57.5%, respectively, while the T. vivax assay had estimated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 81.3% and 81.3%, respectively. The two assays conducted in parallel had estimated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 82.5% and 88.7%, respectively. Using the sera from the cattle in the area with control (detected prevalence of trypanosomosis 0%), both the T. congolense and T. vivax assays had negative and positive predictive values of 100% and 0%, respectively. Using the sera from the cattle in the area without control (detected prevalence of trypanosomosis 15%), the T. congolense assay had negative and positive predictive values of 91% and 33%, respectively, and the T. vivax assay had negative and positive predictive values of 93% and 27%, respectively. The T. congolense assay was in fair agreement with the buffy coat technique (BCT) (kappa = 0.25), while the T. vivax assay was in substantial agreement with the BCT (kappa = 0.625), and both assays conducted in parallel were in substantial agreement with the BCT (kappa = 0.708). Both assays were found to be proficient and suitable for the diagnosis of bovine trypanosomosis, especially when used in parallel."
A comparative analysis of microscopy and PCR based detection methods for Babesia and Trypanosoma infecting bovines and assessment of risk factors,"The present study was carried out to evaluate and compare the status of infection and assessment of risk factors in 353 blood samples (144 cattle and 209 buffaloes) of bovines by PCR assay along with microscopic examinations (ME). ME revealed prevalence of Babesia bigemina and Trypanosoma evansi to be 22.91% and 0.69%, respectively in cattle and 12.44% and 0.95%, respectively in buffaloes. Conversely, PCR assay was able to detect 40.97% and 3.47 % prevalence of B. bigemina and T. evansi in cattle and 23.92% and 6.69% in buffaloes, respectively. The result revealed that the PCR assay was 100% sensitive and 82.9% specific when compared with ME for babesiosis and 100% sensitive and 95.42% specific for trypanosomosis. Multivariate logistic regression models showed that risk of babesiosis was significantly higher in cattle (Odds ratio (OR) =2.207, P=0.001) compared to buffaloes. The risk for surra in male buffaloes increased by 6.37 times (OR=6.375, P=0.013). Conversely, risk of babesiosis was significantly lower in male cattle than females (OR= 0.467, P=0.044)."

"Epidemiological Aspects of Visceral Leishmaniasis in Baft District, Kerman Province, Southeast of Iran","Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) is an endemic disease in some areas of Iran. A cross- sectional study was conducted for sero-epidemiological survey of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Baft district from Kerman Province, southeast of Iran. Methods: Blood samples were collected from children up to 12 years old and 10% of adult population from Baft villages with a multi-stage randomized cluster sampling. In addition, blood samples were collected from 30 domestic dogs from the same areas. All the collected blood samples were tested by direct agglutination test (DAT) for the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies in both human and dog using the cut-off value of >= 1:3200 and >= 1:320, respectively. Parasitological, molecular, and pathological were performed on infected dogs. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare sero-prevalence values. Results: From 1476 collected human serum samples, 23 (1.55%) showed anti-Leishmania antibodies at titers of 1:800 and 1:1600 whereas 14 (0.95%) showed anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies at titers of >= 1:3200. No statistically significant difference was found between male (1.18 %) and female (0.69%) sero-prevalence (P=0.330). Children of 5-8 years showed the highest sero-prevalence rate (3.22%). Seven out of 30 domestic dogs (23%) showed anti-Leishmania antibodies at titers >= 1:320. Leishmania infantum was identified in five infected dogs by nested-PCR assay. Conclusion: It seems that visceral leishmaniasis is being endemic in southern villages of Baft district, southeast of Iran."
"Molecular detection of Leishmania infantum, filariae and Wolbachia spp. in dogs from southern Portugal","Background: Leishmaniosis caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum and dirofilariosis caused by the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis or Dirofilaria repens are vector-borne zoonoses widely present in the Mediterranean basin. In addition, some studies reported that the endosymbiont Wolbachia spp. play a role in the biology and pathogenesis of filarial parasites. The aim of this work was to evaluate the frequency of mono-and co-infections by L. infantum, filariae and Wolbachia spp. and their association with clinical signs in dogs from the south of Portugal. Leishmanial, filarial and Wolbachia spp. DNA were evaluated by specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays in blood samples from 230 dogs. Findings: One hundred and thirty-nine (60.4 %) dogs were qPCR-positive for L. infantum and 26 (11.3 %) for filariae (24 for D. immitis only, one D. immitis and for Acanthocheilonema dracunculoides and another one for Acanthocheilonema reconditum only). Wolbachia spp. DNA was amplified from 16 (64.0 %) out of the 25 D. immitis-positive dogs. Nineteen (8.3 %) dogs were co-infected with L. infantum and D. immitis, including the one (0.4 %) A. drancunculoides-positive animal. In dogs without clinical signs consistent with leishmaniosis and/or dirofilariosis, L. infantum prevalence was 69 %, whereas in those dogs with at least one clinical manifestation compatible with any of the two parasitoses prevalence was 42.7 %. Leishmania prevalence was significantly higher in apparently healthy mongrels (77.2 %) and pets (76.9 %) than in defined-breed dogs (including crosses; 58.8 %) and in dogs with an aptitude other than pet (i.e. farm, guard, hunting, shepherd or stray), respectively, whereas in those dogs with at least one clinical sign, the detection of L. infantum DNA was higher in males (53.3 %) and in those dogs not receiving insect repellents (52.8 %). Conclusions: The molecular detection of canine vector-borne disease (CVBD) agents, some of which are zoonotic, reinforces the need to implement efficient prophylactic measures, such as insect repellents and macrocyclic lactones (including compliance to administration), in the geographical areas where these agents are distributed, with the view to prevent infection and disease among mammalian hosts including humans."
"Serological investigation of Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis and Angiostrongylus vasorum in dogs from southern Portugal","Background: Leishmaniosis, dirofilariosis and angiostrongylosis are parasitic diseases of established importance in dogs worldwide. The aim of the present report was to determine all together levels of infection with or exposure to Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis and Angiostrongylus vasorum in dogs from the Algarve region, in southern Portugal. Findings: Serum samples were obtained from a total of 170 apparently healthy dogs. Antibodies to L. infantum were detected by the direct agglutination test; and antigens of D. immitis and of A. vasorum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an immunochromatography test, respectively. Antibodies to L. infantum were found in 18.2% (31/170) of dogs, while D. immitis antigen was detected in 9.4% (16/170). None of 120 dogs tested out of the 170 under investigation had evidence of infection with A. vasorum. D. immitis infection was more prevalent in dogs aged 84-204 months than in those younger than 12 months. Three dogs were positive to both L. infantum and D. immitis. Conclusions: Dogs living in southern Portugal are at risk of leishmaniosis and dirofilariosis. This scenario should make the veterinary community, local dog owners and also tourists from non-endemic countries coming on vacation with their pets aware of the need of effective prophylactic measures, in order to protect animals and public health."
"Feline Leishmania infection in a canine leishmaniasis endemic region, Portugal","Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum is a serious zoonotic public health and veterinary problem in the Mediterranean basin. Leishmania infection in domestic cats (Felis catus domesticus) has been reported in several countries where this zoonosis is endemic, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Israel, Palestine and Brazil. The aim of this study was to contribute to the knowledge of the role played by cats in Leishmania epidemiology, in an endemic focus of zoonotic leishmaniasis, the Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal. L infantum DNA was detected in peripheral blood of 28 out of 138 cats (20.3%). The result of PCR in blood of cats was not closely associated with the level of specific circulating antibodies in their sera. Positive serology was observed only in one cat out of 76. In the same geographic region and time period the indirect immunofluorescent test revealed 20.4% (31/152) of dogs with antibodies and PCR detected Leismania DNA on 34.9% (53/152) animals. Despite the fact that specific antibodies have been validated for diagnosis of CanL, their detection does not seem to be sensitive enough to predict Leishmania infection in cats. On the other hand, the presence of parasite DNA in cat's peripheral blood during the transmission season and out of the season suggests that these animals living in endemic areas are frequently exposed or infected with the parasite. Although dogs have been universally regarded as the major domestic/peridomestic reservoir hosts, the present data allow us to hypothesize that cats can act as an alternative reservoir host of L infantum, rather than an accidental host. However, in order to evaluate the existence of a transmission cycle with cats sustaining and spreading zoonotic leishmaniasis is necessary to prove that these animals can transmit the parasite to the vector in nature.

Bacterial and protozoal agents of feline vector-borne diseases in domestic and stray cats from southern Portugal,"Background: Feline vector-borne diseases (FVBD) have emerged in recent years, showing a wider geographic distribution and increased global prevalence. In addition to their veterinary importance, domestic cats play a central role in the transmission cycles of some FVBD agents by acting as reservoirs and sentinels, a circumstance that requires a One Health approach. The aim of the present work was to molecularly detect feline vector-borne bacteria and protozoa with veterinary and zoonotic importance, and to assess associated risk factors in cats from southern Portugal. Methods: Six hundred and forty-nine cats (320 domestic and 329 stray), from veterinary medical centres and animal shelters in southern Portugal, were studied. Anaplasma spp./Ehrlichia spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Hepatozoon spp. and Leishmania spp. infections were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood samples. Results: One hundred and ninety-four (29.9%) cats were PCR-positive to at least one of the tested genera or complex of FVBD agents. Sixty-four (9.9%) cats were positive to Leishmania spp., 56 (8.6%) to Hepatozoon spp., 43 (6.6%) to Babesia spp., 35 (5.4%) to Anaplasma spp./Ehrlichia spp., 19 (2.9%) to Bartonella spp. and 14 (2.2%) to B. burgdorferi s.l. Thirty-three (5.1%) cats were positive to two (n = 29) or three (n = 4) genera/complex. Babesia vogeli, Bartonella clarridgeiae, Bartonella henselae, Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon felis and Leishmania infantum were identified by DNA sequencing. Conclusions: The occurrence of FVBD agents in southern Portugal, some of them with zoonotic character, emphasizes the need to alert the veterinary community, owners and public health authorities for the risk of infection. Control measures should be implemented to prevent the infection of cats, other vertebrate hosts and people."
Prevalence of Dirofilaria immitis antigen and antibodies to Leishmania infantum in cats from southern Portugal,"Vector-borne diseases (VBD) are caused by a range of pathogens transmitted by arthropods and have emerged in recent years, showing a wider geographic distribution and increased global prevalence. In addition to their veterinary medical importance, cats play a central role in the transmission cycles of some VBD agents by acting as reservoirs, amplifying hosts or sentinels. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Dirofilaria immitis antigen and of antibodies to Leishmania infantum in a sample of 271 cats from southern Portugal. Thirteen (4.8%) cats were positive to D. immitis, while antibodies to L. infantum were detected in 10 (3.7%) animals. The prevalence of D. immitis and L. infantum in the feline population from southern Portugal should alert for the need to implement control measures to protect animals and people from these zoonotic parasites. Furthermore, both parasitoses must be included in the differential diagnosis in feline clinical practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"A longitudinal survey of African animal trypanosomiasis in domestic cattle on the Jos Plateau, Nigeria: prevalence, distribution and risk factors","Background: Trypanosomiasis is a widespread disease of livestock in Nigeria and a major constraint to the rural economy. The Jos Plateau, Nigeria was free from tsetse flies and the trypanosomes they transmit due to its high altitude and the absence of animal trypanosomiasis attracted large numbers of cattle-keeping pastoralists to inhabit the plateau. The Jos Plateau now plays a significant role in the national cattle industry, accommodating approximately 7% of the national herd and supporting 300,000 pastoralists and over one million cattle. However, during the past two decades tsetse flies have invaded the Jos Plateau and animal trypanosomiasis has become a significant problem for livestock keepers. Methods: In 2008 a longitudinal two-stage cluster survey on the Jos Plateau. Cattle were sampled in the dry, early wet and late wet seasons. Parasite identification was undertaken using species-specific polymerase chain reactions to determine the prevalence and distribution bovine trypanosomiasis. Logistic regression was performed to determine risk factors for disease. Results: The prevalence of bovine trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma brucei brucei, Trypanosoma congolense savannah, Trypanosoma vivax) across the Jos Plateau was found to be high at 46.8% (39.0 - 54.5%) and significant, seasonal variation was observed between the dry season and the end of the wet season. T. b. brucei was observed at a prevalence of 3.2% (1% - 5.5%); T. congolense at 27.7% (21.8% - 33.6%) and T. vivax at 26.7% (18.2% - 35.3%). High individual variation was observed in trypanosomiasis prevalence between individual villages on the Plateau, ranging from 8.8% to 95.6%. Altitude was found to be a significant risk factor for trypanosomiasis whilst migration also influenced risk for animal trypanosomiasis. Conclusions: Trypanosomiasis is now endemic on the Jos Plateau showing high prevalence in cattle and is influenced by seasonality, altitude and migration practices. Attempts to successfully control animal trypanosomiasis on the Plateau will need to take into account the large variability in trypanosomiasis infection rates between villages, the influence of land use, and husbandry and management practices of the pastoralists, all of which affect the epidemiology of the disease."
"Parasitological and serological diagnosis of trypanosomiasis in cattle in the Northern-Kivu province, Congo",A hundred and eighty Ankole cattle were tested for trypanosomiasis in four districts in the Northen-Kivu province of Congo. The thin blood film technique revealed 23.9 p. 100 of infections while 61.7 lj: 100 of animals were positive for the antigen - trapping (Ag -ELISA) method. Trypanosoma brucei was the most frequent aethiological agent (44.3 p.100) followed by T. congolense (33.8 p. 100) and T. vivax (21.9 p.100). Significant differences of infection rates were observed between districts (p < 0.05) suggesting a relationship to the geographical distribution of glossines and to the food value of the pastures available to cattle. The high frequency of I brucei cir culating antigens (97.0 p.100) and of mixed infections with the coexistence of the ?: brucei and T. congolense species shows the need to reconsider the use of diminazene aceturate (3.5 mg/kg) and isometamidium chloride (0.5 mg/kg) in chemotherapy as the main control measure against infections.
"Multiple Trypanosoma infections are common amongst Glossina species in the new farming areas of Rufiji district, Tanzania","Background: Tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis are among several factors that constrain livestock development in Tanzania. Over the years Rufiji District was excluded from livestock production owing to tsetse fly infestation, however, a few years ago there was an influx of livestock following evictions aimed at conserving the Usangu wetlands. Methods: A study was conducted to determine the efficiency of available traps for catching tsetse flies, Glossina species infesting the area, their infection rates and Trypanosoma species circulating in the area. Trapping was conducted during the semi dry season for a total of 30 days (ten days each month) during the onset of the dry season of May - July 2009. Harvested flies after every 24 hours were dissected and examined under a light microscope for trypanosome infections and whole fly DNA was extracted from 82 flies and analyzed for trypanosomes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using different sets of primers. Results: The proportions of total tsetse catches per trap were in the following decreasing order S3 (33%), H-Trap (27%), Pyramidal (19%), sticky panel (11%) and biconical trap (10%). Of the 1200 trapped flies, 75.6% were identified as Glossina pallidipes, 11.7% as G. brevipalpis, 9.6% as G. austeni and 3.0% G. morsitans morsitans. Dissections revealed the overall infection rate of 6.6% (13/197). Whole DNA was extracted from 82 tsetse flies and the prevalence of trypanosomes circulating in the area in descending order was 92.7% (76/82) for T. simiae; 70.7% (58/82) for T. brucei types; 48.8% (40/82) for the T. vivax types and 32.9% (27/82) for the T. congolense types as determined by PCR. All trypanosome types were found in all tsetse species analysed except for the T. congolense types, which were absent in G. m. morsitans. None of the T. brucei positive samples contained human infective trypanosomes by SRA - PCR test Conclusion: All tsetse species found in Rufiji are biologically important in the transmission of animal trypanosomiasis and the absence of T. congolense in G. m. morsitans could be a matter of chance only. Therefore, plans for control should consider all tsetse species."
The use of specific and generic primers to identify trypanosome infections of wild tsetse flies in Tanzania by PCR,"The accurate identification of trypanosome species and subspecies remains a challenging task in the epidemiology of human and animal trypanosomiasis in tropical Africa. Currently, there are specific PCR tests to identify about 10 different species, subspecies or subgroups of African tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes. These PCR tests have been used here to identify trypanosomes in four species of tsetse (Glossina brevipalpis, G. pallidipes, G. swynnertoni, G. morsitans morsitans) from two areas of Tanzania. PCR using species-specific primers was performed on 1041 dissection-positive proboscides, giving an overall positive identification in 254 (24%). Of these, 61 proboscides (24%) contained two or more trypanosomes. The trypanosome with the greatest overall prevalence at both field sites was Trypanosoma simiae Tsavo, which was identified in a total of 118 infected tsetse proboscides (46%). At Pangani, T. godfreyi was found in G. pallidipes but not in G. brevipalpis, suggesting that these flies might have different susceptibility to this trypanosome or might have fed on a different range of hosts. A high proportion (about 75%) of trypanosome infections remained unidentified. To investigate the identity of these unidentified samples, we used primers complementary to the conserved regions of trypanosomal small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA) genes to amplify variable segments of the gene. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned, sequenced and compared with ssu rRNA genes on database of known trypanosome species. In this way, we have tentatively identified two new trypanosomes: a trypanosome related to Trypanosoma vivax and a trypanosome related to T. godfreyi. The T. godfreyi-related trypanosome occurred frequently in the Tanzanian field samples and appears to be widespread. Molecular identification of these two new trypanosomes should now facilitate their isolation and full biological characterisation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Patterns of parasite infection in bumble bees (Bombus spp.) of Northern Virginia,"1. In recent decades, several North American bumble bee (Bombus spp.) species have undergone precipitous declines. It is suspected that a parasite or pathogen may be responsible, yet few studies have examined the extent of parasitism and the ecology of host-parasite relationships in U. S. bumble bee populations. 2. A season-long survey of bumble bees in seven grassland meadows of the northern Shenandoah Valley and Piedmont regions in Virginia was conducted in 2011 to ascertain the local prevalence and predictors of parasitism by the internal parasites Nosema and Crithidia, and by parasitoid conopid flies. 3. In total, 835 bumble bees representing six species were examined. Using visual detection methods, we determined that 25% of bees were infected with parasitoid larvae, 17.4% with Crithidia, and 7.3% with Nosema. 4. Nosema infections were more prevalent and intense in locally rare than locally common species, with the two rarest bumble bees [B. fervidus (Fabricius) and B. auricomus (Robertson)], newly suspected to be in decline, having the highest frequencies of infection (11-17.8%). 5. Crithidia was generally more prevalent in common bumble bee species (11-35%). With fewer than 5% of individuals infected, the two rarest species had the lowest frequencies of Crithidia. Conopid fly larvae were more prevalent in common species. 6. Body size significantly influenced the probability of parasitism by conopids and Crithidia. Smaller bees were more likely to be parasitised by Crithidia. Larger bees were more likely to be parasitised by conopid flies, although the largest bee species (B. auricomus) was not infected by conopids in this study."
SEROPREVALENCE OF TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI IN RACCOONS FROM TENNESSEE,"Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease. Autochthonous human and canine transmission of T. cruzi has been documented in Tennessee, but little is known about its ecology, including the prevalence of T. cruzi among wildlife in Tennessee. Serum samples from 706 raccoons (Procyon lotor) from 10 counties in the Ridge and Valley and Blue Ridge Mountains ecoregions of eastern Tennessee were tested for antibodies reactive with T cruzi using the indirect fluorescent antibody assay. Two hundred six (29.2%) samples were seropositive, with 9 counties yielding positive samples (range 14.6-63.6%). Significantly more raccoons from rural habitats (35.1%) were found positive for T cruzi exposure than were those from suburban habitats (23.1%, P < 0.001). Land cover class was not associated with seropositivity status (P = 0.441), even though deciduous forest was the most common site from where raccoons were trapped and the most common site of positive raccoons in rural areas (42%). Interestingly, age was positively associated with seropositivity. Raccoons older than 1 yr (adults) were 40.1% seropositive compared to 12.2% of those less than 1 yr (juveniles; P < 0.001). Female adults were significantly more likely to be exposed to T. cruzi than were male adult raccoons (P < 0.001). No significant seroprevalence difference was seen among male and female juveniles. This study contributes to understanding the dynamics of T. cruzi exposure within raccoon populations in Tennessee. The importance of habitat (rural vs. suburban) and microhabitat (dens) in risk of exposure to these populations is also discussed."
Seroprevalences of vector-transmitted infections of small-holder dairy cattle in coastal Kenya,"A cross-sectional study was carried out from July to September 1989 in Kaloleni Division, Coast Province, Kenya to estimate the prevalence of vector-transmitted diseases in small-holder dairy cattle and to identify the risk factors associated with different management systems. One hundred and thirty of the 157 herds with dairy cattle in Kaloleni Division were surveyed. These were from three agro-ecological zones (coconut-cassava, cashewnut-cassava and livestock-millet), comprised two management systems (stall-feeding and herded grazing) and were herds with either dairy cattle only or with Zebu and dairy cattle. A formal questionnaire sought answers to questions on cattle health and management practices. A total of 734 dairy and 205 Zebu cattle in 78 dairy and 52 mixed (dairy and Zebu) herds were sampled and screened for haemoparasites (Trypanosoma, Anaplasma, Babesia, and Theileria infections). Sera were tested for antibodies to Theileria parva, using the schizonts-antigen indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) test and to antibodies for Babesia bigemina and antigens to Anaplasma marginale by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Packed-cell volume (PCV) also was measured. Tick-control measures were practised by all except three of the farmers. Despite this, overall seroprevalence to T. parva was > 70% - suggesting either that control practices were not strictly implemented or they were ineffective. The seroprevalence of T parva in adult cattle kept in stallfeeding systems in the coconut-cassava zone was significantly lower (57 +/- 8% (S.E.)) than in herded-grazing systems (79 +/- 3%) and there was no association between antibody prevalence and age of cattle in this zone. Antibody prevalences in cattle in the cashewnut-cassava and the drier livestock-millet zone increased with age. Cattle in herded-grazing systems had an overall lower seroprevalence of T parva infection in the livestock-millet zone (45 +/- 6%) than in the other two zones."
Animal trypanosomosis in clinically healthy cattle of north Cameroon: epidemiological implications,"Background: The control of animal trypanosomosis consists, amongst other things, of the punctual treatment of new cases, primarily diagnosed by pastoralists on the basis of clinical signs. This practice suggests that many apparently healthy infected animals are left untreated. In this study animal trypanosomosis in clinically healthy zebu cattle was evaluated, the distribution of the vectors established and the epidemiological implications discussed. Methods: In 2014 two cross-sectional surveys were carried out in the Cambeef ranch. A total of 866 blood samples were collected from cattle in different sites: 549 in the dry season and 317 in the rainy season. The blood samples were subjected to parasitological examination using the buffy coat method and to PCV determination. An entomological survey on animal trypanosomosis vectors was undertaken during tsetse flies caught were identified and the mid-gut of each living non-teneral tsetse fly was examined for infections using a microscope. Results: An overall trypanosomosis prevalence of 9 % was found in the cattle examined. There were significantly (P < 0.05) more trypanosome infected cattle in the dry season than the rainy season. Trypanosome-infected cattle had significantly (P < 0.05) lower Body Condition Scores (BCS) and Packed Cell Volumes (PCV) in the dry season than in the rainy season. Anemia was positively correlated with trypanosome infection. The likelihood for an animal to be parasitologically free of trypanosome infection was at least three times as high in the Gudali breed as compared with the white and red Fulani breeds. Species of trypanosomes identified were Trypanosoma vivax (73.23 %), Trypanosoma congolense (15.49 %) and Trypanosoma brucei (11.27 %). A total of 390 tsetse flies and 103 tabanids were trapped. Two species of tsetse flies were identified: Glossina tachinoides (33.59 %) and G. morsitans submorsitans (41 %). Nine of the 194 non-teneral flies were infected with trypanosomes. Conclusion: Carriers of trypanosomes are present amongst apparently healthy cattle in the study site. Attempts to successfully reduce the population of reservoir trypanosomes within herds and control the disease will need to consider mass screening once every year and this should be associated with drug sensitivity tests."
Prevalence and incidence of bovine trypanosomosis on the Adamaoua plateau in Cameroon 10 years after the tsetse eradication campaign,
SEROLOGIC SURVEY FOR LEISHMANIASIS IN FREE-LIVING RED FOXES (VULPES-VULPES) IN ITALY,"Sera from fifty free-ranging red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from the Imperia province, Liguria, Italy, were examined for antibodies against Leishmania spp. by both immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), from January to May 1992. Nine of 50 animals (18%) had antibodies against Leishmania spp. utilizing both IFA and ELISA tests."
Parasite infection of specific host genotypes relates to changes in prevalence in two natural populations of bumblebees,"The antagonistic relationship between parasites and their hosts is strongly influenced by genotype-by-genotype interactions. Defense against parasitism is commonly studied in the context of immune system-based mechanisms and, thus, the focus in the search for candidate genes in host-parasite interactions is often on immune genes. In this study, we investigated the association between prevalence of parasite infection and host mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes in two natural populations of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). The two most common haplotypes of the host populations, termed A and B, differ by a single nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution within the coding region of cytochrome oxidase I, an important player in metabolic pathways. We screened infection by Nosema bombi, a common endoparasite of bumblebees, and the corresponding host mtDNA-haplotype frequencies in over 1400 bumblebees between 2000 and 2010. The island population of Gotland showed lower mtDNA diversity compared to the mainland population in Switzerland. Over time, we observed large fluctuations in infection prevalence, as well as variation in host haplotype frequencies in both populations. Our long-term observation revealed that N. bombi infection of specific host genotypes is transient: We found that with increasing infection prevalence, proportionally more individuals with haplotype B, but fewer individuals with haplotype A were infected. This suggests that the presence of N. bombi in specific host genotypes relates to infection prevalence. This may be a result of parasite competition, or differential resilience of host types to ward off infections. The findings highlight the important role of host mtDNA haplotypes in the interaction with parasites."
"Serological and entomological survey of canine leishmaniasis in Lampedusa island, Italy","Background: During last decade Lampedusa island (Italy) has been interested by a deep social change caused by the massive arrival of migrants from north Africa. The goal of this study was to evaluate current CanL burden and risk factors for Visceral Leishmaniosis (VL) on Lampedusa, actually based on very few data obtained in a previous study performed fifteen years ago. Two hundred and forty-two dogs were enrolled for the detection of Leishmania infantum infection by serology. In addition, an entomological investigation was performed to confirm the presence of Leishmania-vectors. Results: Seroprevalence was of 54.13%. 223 sand flies specimens were collected. Among them, 4 species were identified: Phlebotomus perniciosus, P. papatasi, P. neglectus, Sergentomia minuta, with P. perniciosus the most abundant (67.7%; p < 0.01). Conclusion: The high proportion of seropositive dogs together with the presence of the most competent vector for L. infantum, P. perniciosus, demonstrate that L. infantum abundantly circulates in the island and may constitute a risk for people, particularly for hosted migrants."
Molecular detection of Leishmania braziliensis in Rattus norvegicus in an area endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil,"Leishmania nested PCR (LnPCR) targeted to the SSUrRNA gene and DNA sequencing were used to analyze 315 tissue samples from 80 Rattus norvegicus specimens trapped in an area endemic for leishmaniasis in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Of the samples analyzed, 17.46% (55/315) of all tissues, 10% (8/80) of skin, 26.92% (21/78) of blood, 30.76% (24/78) of bone marrow and 2.53% (2/79) of spleen were positive for Leishmania. The overall infection prevalence was 36.25% (29/80) The DNA sequencing showed that 65.51% (19/29) of the positive animals were infected by parasites belonging to the Leishmania braziliensis complex. The identification of L braziliensis DNA in R. norvegicus in an area with a high prevalence of leishmaniasis might imply a zoonotic role of this species. The rodent control programs and health education may represent important measures toward the control of leishmaniasis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Comparison of three blood transfusion guidelines applied to 31 feline donors to minimise the risk of transfusion-transmissible infections,"Objectives The increased demand for animal blood transfusions creates the need for an adequate number of donors. At the same time, a high level of blood safety must be guaranteed and different guidelines (GLs) deal with this topic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of different GLs in preventing transfusion-transmissible infections (TTI) in Italian feline blood donors. Methods Blood samples were collected from 31 cats enrolled as blood donors by the owners' voluntary choice over a period of approximately 1 year. Possible risk factors for TTI were recorded. Based on Italian, European and American GLs, specific TTI, including haemoplasmas, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia species, Bartonella species, Babesia species, Theileria species, Cytauxzoon species, Leishmania donovani sensu lato and feline coronavirus (FCoV), were screened. Rapid antigen and serological tests and biomolecular investigations (PCR) were used. Several PCR protocols for haemoplasma and FeLV DNA were compared. Results The presence of at least one recognised risk factor for TTI was reported in all cats. Results for FIV and FeLV infections were negative using rapid tests, whereas five (16.1%) cats were positive for FCoV antibodies. Four (12.9%) cats were PCR positive for haemoplasma DNA and one (3.2%) for FeLV provirus, the latter being positive only using the most sensitive PCR protocol applied. Other TTI were not detected using PCR. Conclusions and relevance Blood safety increases by combining the recommendations of different GLs. To reduce the risk of TTI, sensitive tests are needed and the choice of the best protocol is a critical step in improving blood safety. The cost and time of the screening procedures may be reduced if appropriate tests are selected. To this end, the GLs should include appropriate recruitment protocols and questionnaire-based risk profiles to identify suitable donors."
"Phlebotomine Sand Flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) and Leishmania Infection in Gafanhoto Park, Divinopolis, Brazil","The potential of Gafanhoto Park as an American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) focus was evaluated by examination of sand fly vectors of the Leishmania parasite. This forest remnant is located in a periurban area of Divinopolis, Brazil, where autochthonous cases of ACL have been reported. Sand fly populations were monitored over a 2-yr period (2006-2008) by using light traps (HP and Shannon). During systematic collections with HP traps, 824 specimens in total (342 males and 482 females) of 21 species were captured. Most prevalent species were as follows: Brumptomyia brumpti (Larrouse), Lutzomyia aragaoi (Costa Lima), Lutzomyia lutziana (Costa Lima), Lutzomyia sordellii (Shannon & Del Ponte), and Lutzomyia whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho). Using Shannon traps, 257 specimens representing 15 species were collected (159 females and 98 males), with a high prevalence of L. whitmani and Lutzomyia neivai (Pinto), both vectors of Leishmania braziliensis (Vianna). To ascertain the level of natural infection, a sample of females captured in Shannon traps was assayed for the presence of Leishmania by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, where 39% of insects were positive. The most infected species was L. whitmani (29 sand flies; 18.2%), followed by L. neivai (21; 13.2%), Lutzomyia christenseni (Young & Duncan) (five; 3.1%), Lutzomyia pessoai (Coutinho & Barreto) (three; 1.9%), L. aragaoi (one; 0.6%), Lutzomyia fischeri (Pinto) (one; 0.6%), Lutzomyia lenti (Mangabeira) (one; 0.6%), L. lutziana (one; 0.6%), and Lutzomyia monticula (Costa Lima) (one; 0.6%). The finding of potential and incriminated vectors naturally infected with Leishmania reinforces the need of epidemiologic surveillance in the area."
"Prevalence and distribution of parasites and pathogens of Triatominae from Argentina, with emphasis on Triatoma infestans and Triatoma virus TrV",
Infection by Leishmania infantum in cats: Epidemiological study in Spain,"More than 40 cases of feline leishmaniasis have been reported in the scientific literature. The influence of some immunodepressive conditions of viral origin, such as leukemia and feline immunodeficiency, are still unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of Leishmania infection in cats and possible relations with these viral infections. Markers of Leishmania infection were searched in 183 cats from Southern Spain by IFAT, PCR, Giemsa stain and culture, with a follow-up of positive cats. Seropositivity was 60.0% (Ab titer >= 10) and 28.3% of animals presented Ab titers >= 40. Around 25.7% of the cats studied were parasitemic and some of them remained positive for months. Combining both data, 70.6% of the feline population was, or could be, infected. We observed a negative association between seropositivity to Leishmania and infection by FeLV. Hence, production of antibodies against the parasite appears to be compromised in cats with leukemia, which have a prevalence of 36% in our study. In contrast, we found no association with feline immunodeficiency. The results makes us doubt the value of conventional serological methods to detect active Leishmania infection in cats.

"Pool screen PCR for estimating the prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in sandflies (Diptera : Nematocera, Phlebotomidae)","Prevalence studies of infection in the sandfly vector can be used as an indicator of a change in the intensity of Leishmania transmission. However, these studies are difficult to carry out as prevalence in the vector is usually tow and its estimation requires a large number of sandflies to be dissected. Our objective was to establish whether a L. infantum-specific PCR-ELISA applied to pools of female sandflies and a previously described algorithm could be useful tools to study the prevalence of infection by this parasite in natural vector populations. We collected sandflies from six collection points in two stable foci of leishmaniasis in southern (N= 3) and north-eastern (N= 3) Spain, following standard procedures. A fraction of the collected females was dissected and morphologically identified. Another fraction was used for pool screening. In total, 127 pools of 30 females (3810 specimens) were studied by PCR-ELISA and 1764 specimens were individually dissected. The prevalence of infection determined by dissection does not differ from that determined by pool screen PCR. The results suggest that pool screen PCR can be of practical use in the epidemiological surveillance of leishmaniasis in European countries of the western Mediterranean basin, associated with control interventions or global change.

"Follow up of natural infection with Trypanosoma cruzi in two mammals species, Nasua narica and Procyon lotor (Carnivora: Procyonidae): evidence of infection control?","Background: A large variety of mammals act as natural reservoirs of Trypanosoma cruzi (the causal agent of Chagas disease) across the American continent. Related issues are infection and parasite burden in these reservoirs, and whether they are able to control T. cruzi infections. These parameters can indicate the real role of mammals as T. cruzi reservoirs and transmitters. Here, two species of mammals, white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) and raccoon (Procyon lotor), were examined for to determine: a) T. cruzi presence, and; b) their ability to control T. cruzi infection. Methods: Multiple capture-recaptures of both species were carried out in semi-wild conditions in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico, for 5 years. Two samplings per year (summer and winter) took place. Prevalence and pattern of T. cruzi infection were determined by PCR from both mammals' blood samples. Results: Raccoon samples had a higher relative infection values (26.6%) compared to those of white-nosed coati (9.05%), being this difference significant in summer 2012 (P < 0.00001), summer (P = 0.03) and winter 2013 (P = 0.02). Capture and recapture data indicated three infection dynamics: 1) negative-positive-negative infection; 2) positive-negative-positive infection; and 3) positive at all sampling times. Conclusions: These results indicate that both coati and raccoons may be able to control T. cruzi infection. Thus, the role as efficient reservoirs could be questioned (at least for those times when mammals are able to tolerate the infection). However, while infected, they may also be able to approach human dwellings and play a role important in linking sylvatic and domestic cycles."
"Serological and molecular inquiry of Chagas disease in an Afro-descendant settlement in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil","Furnas do Dionoisio is a Brazilian Afro-descendant settlement in the city of Jaraguari, 21.4 miles from Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Approximately 96 families live in this quilombola (Maroon) settlement, also known in Brazil as a remnant community of descendants of African slaves. Recent studies found 20% of households were infested by triatomines, 18% of insects captured in the community were infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, and 22.7% of dogs presented T. cruzi antibodies. The low prevalence of Chagas disease observed in humans in Mato Grosso do Sul State is attributed to its arrival via colonist migration and subsequent transplacental transmission. In order to gain a better understanding of the T. cruzi cycle in residents of the study community, serological and molecular tests were carried out to diagnose Chagas disease. In the present study, 175 residents between 2 and 80 years old were included. A total of 175 participants were interviewed and 170 provided blood samples, which were tested for T. cruzi antibodies with serological tests. Molecular diagnosis was performed in 167 participants by PCR (KDNA) and NPCR (satellite DNA) tests. One of the 170 samples tested positive for all serological tests performed. The overall frequency of Chagas disease in the community was low (0.6%). Interview responses revealed that 66.3% knew of triatomine insects and 65.7% reported having had no contact with them. Physical improvements to residences, together with vector surveillance and control by the State and municipal governments and local ecological conservation contribute to the low frequency of the Chagas disease in this quilombola community."
"Prevalence and risk factors for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease in the canine population of the tourist city of Ibiuna, Sao Paulo, Brazil","The aims of the study were to determine the seroprevalence of leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, and to determine the risk factors associated with seropositivity in dogs in the tourist city of Ibiuna, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A total of 570 blood samples of dogs were collected from four regions in the 48 districts of the municipality, from September 2007 to March 2008, and submitted for serological examination. Laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis and Chagas disease was performed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence, respectively. Of the 570 animals examined, 13 (2.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2%-3.8%) were seropositive for leishmaniasis, and 35 (6.1%; 95% CI = 4.3%-8.3%) were seropositive for Chagas disease. A risk factor associated with seropositivity for Chagas disease in dogs was residence in a region with a predominance of small farms generally used for subsistence planting and leisure and surrounded by forest areas (odds ratio = 4.20). By contrast, there were no risk factors identified for leishmaniasis, leading us to conclude that leishmaniasis and Chagas disease are present in dogs in the tourist city of Ibiuna, Sao Paulo; however, additional studies are needed in order to fully define the risk factors associated with disease in this municipality."
"A high prevalence of mixed trypanosome infections in tsetse flies in Sinfra, Cote d'Ivoire, detected by DNA amplification","The prevalence of various species and subgroups of trypanosomes in the Sinfra area of Cote d'Ivoire was determined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using this technique to amplify specific satellite DNA targets, it was possible to identify developmental-stage trypanosomes in the midguts and the proboscides of tsetse without expansion of parasite populations. The predominant tsetse species in the area was Glossina palpalis, while G. pallicera and G. nigrofusca were also present. Microscopical examination of 811 non-teneral flies revealed an infection rate of 14% in midguts and/or proboscides. Three subgroups of Trypanosoma congolense (Savannah, Forest & Kilifi), T. simiae, T. godfreyi, West African T. vivax and T. brucei ssp. were identified using PCR. T. congolense Forest was the most abundant of the Nannomonas trypanosomes. Approximately 40% of all infections were mixed, and there was a significantly higher prevalence of apparently mature T. brucei ssp. trypanosomes than has previously been reported. The present study demonstrates that PCR facilitates the easy identification of mature trypanosome infections in tsetse, providing a reliable estimation of trypanosomiasis challenge."
Growth and mortality in sheep and goats under high tsetse challenge in Kenya,"Trypanosomosis is a major impediment to livestock production and economic development in those areas of Africa where it is endemic. Although small ruminants appear to perform better than cattle in various agro-ecological zones, the importance of trypanosomosis has not been extensively investigated in these livestock. This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of trypanosomosis in sheep and goats in an endemic area and to evaluate the performance of different breeds under high tsetse challenge and the potential role of chemoprophylaxis in the control of the disease. The results showed that tsetse flies feed readily on small ruminants, and that these animals are susceptible to trypanosomosis. The Small East African goats acquired fewer infections than the Black Head Persian and Dorper sheep used in the study. In both sheep and goats, chemoprophylaxis with isometamidium chloride (Samorin, Rhone Merieux, Annecy, France) was protective, resulting in fewer infection sand higher body weight gain. Trypanosomosis caused anaemia in both sheep and goats, and animals whose PCV fell below 15% rarely recovered, even with trypanocidal drug treatment. The peak transmission period was between 1 and 3 months after the peak tsetse fly density, which raises the possibility of effective strategic prophylaxis."
Diversity and phylogeny of insect trypanosomatids: all that is hidden shall be revealed,"Monoxenous trypanosomatids, which are usually regarded as benign dwellers of the insect alimentary tract, represent a relatively obscure group within the family Trypanosomatidae. This field of study has long been in disarray with the genus level taxonomy of this group remaining artificial, species criteria elusive, host specificity and occurrence poorly known, and their diversity mostly unexplored. The time has arrived to remedy this situation: a phylogenetic approach has been applied to taxa recognition and description, and a culture-independent (PCR-based) approach for detection and identification of organisms in nature has made it feasible to study the diversity of the group. Although more than 100 typing units have been discovered recently, these appear to represent a small segment of trypanosomatid biodiversity, which still remains to be uncovered."
Discovery and barcoding by analysis of spliced leader RNA gene sequences of new isolates of trypanosomatidae from Heteroptera in Costa Rica and Ecuador,"Trypanosomatid diversity in Heteroptera was sampled using a culture-independent approach based on amplification and sequencing of Spliced Leader RNA gene repeats from environmental samples. By combining the data collected herein with that of previous work, the prevalence of parasites was found to be 22%-23%. Out of approximately 170 host species investigated nearly 60 were found to harbor trypanosomatids. The parasites found were grouped by cluster analysis into 48 typing units. Most of these were well separated from the known groups and, therefore, likely represent new trypanosomatid species. The sequences for each typing unit serve as barcodes to facilitate their recognition in the future. As the sampled host species represent a minor fraction of potential hosts, the entire trypanosomatid diversity is far greater than described thus far. Investigations of trypanosomatid diversity, host-specificity, and biogeography have become feasible using the approach described herein."
"Occurrence, clinical manifestation and the epidemiological implications of naturally occurring canine trypanosomosis in western Kenya","Domestic dogs were screened for Trypanosoma brucei infection using the haematocrit centrifugation technique as part of routine active surveillance exercises in the Busia and Teso districts of Kenya. The purpose was to assess the role of dogs as sentinels for the occurrence of human sleeping sickness. Out of 200 dogs screened, five were found to be infected at the various test sites. These five succumbed to the disease within four weeks, and exhibited a distinct and pronounced corneal opacity before death. Blood from two naturally infected dogs were tested for the presence of the serum resistance associated (SRA) gene and one tested positive, confirming it as human infective (T. brucei rhodesiense) prevalence (0.5 %). It is considered that the occurrence of this clinical sign could be used as an early warning prediction of future outbreaks. This type of prediction could form an integral part of an indigenous technical knowledge set in areas lying at the edges of the tsetse (Glossina) belts where T. brucei is the main trypanosome species that affects dogs. The occurrence of corneal opacity in dogs could indicate a rise in the levels of T brucei a proportion of which could be human infective T. b. rhodesiense circulating in the population early enough before disease outbreak occurs. It is thought that during sleeping sickness epidemics the domestic dog will be the first casualty rapidly succumbing to disease long before it is noticed in man. Prompt prediction of disease outbreaks would thus enable early interventions that would reduce the morbidity, mortality and the general economic losses associated with sleeping sickness to be instituted."
Estimation of trypanosomal status by the buffy coat technique and an antibody ELISA for assessment of the impact of trypanosomosis on health and productivity of N'Dama cattle in The Gambia,"The buffy coat/dark ground phase contrast technique (BCT) and an indirect antibody enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) were employed to assess the trypanosomal status of 32 N'Dama cattle, aged 19-28 months, exposed to natural challenge of Glossina morsitans submorsitans and C. palpalis gambiensis. Prior to the start of the investigation animals experienced 9-16 months of tsetse challenge in the study area. Blood and corresponding serum samples were examined monthly for a period of 8 months for patent parasitaemia by BCT and presence of Trypanosoma vivax and T. congolense antibodies by ELISA. In the ELISA, the reactivity of sera to anti-trypanosomal antibodies was expressed in percent positivity (pp). Packed cell volumes (PCV) and body weights were also recorded monthly, and daily weight gain (DWG) computed to assess the impact of trypanosomal status on health and productivity. During the study period, the overall parasitaemic trypanosome prevalence was 3% (6/199), while the serological prevalence was 54.7% (109/199). Both diagnostic tests revealed a predominance of T. vivax over T. congolense infections in N'Dama cattle. Sensitivity of the immunoassay was 83.3%. In ir: vivax-parasitaemic cattle, antibodies persisted for 4-6 months after the parasite was detected by BCT. A significantly higher overall mean PCV level was observed in blood samples obtained from cattle found, in any particular month, negative by BCT and ELISA, compared with those blood samples from animals responding serologically positively for anti-trypanosome antibodies. Likewise, mean DWG was significantly higher in cattle found negative for both tests in comparison to animals presenting detectable anti-trypanosome antibodies and those detected positive by both tests. A significant negative relationship was observed between pp values and PCV levels in animals seropositive for T. vivax and/or T. congolense. Similarly, a negative relationship was observed between DWGs and pp values. PCV levels were significantly positively correlated with DWGs. It was concluded that serological screening could provide useful information complementary to that obtained by the use of BCT not only to assess more accurately the trypanosomal status of cattle populations, but also to evaluate the effects of trypanosome infection on animal health and productivity and estimate the trypanosomosis risk.

"Rural-urban focus of canine visceral leishmaniosis in the far western region of Santa Catarina State, Brazil","The aim of this work was to investigate the occurrence of canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL) in the far western region of Santa Catarina State, bordering Argentina and Parana State, southern Brazil, where in recent years, VL has been recorded in both dogs and humans. Clinical signs, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used for Leishmania investigation. Among the 252 dogs surveyed, 41 were positive by ELISA assay, 43 in IFAT (titer >40), and 55 by PCR. From the 48 positive for VL by both serological and molecular methods, 19 (39.6%) presented clinical symptoms of leishmaniosis, 35 (72.9%) were from rural areas, and 13 (27.1%) were from urban areas. This pilot study confirms the occurrence of VL among dogs in the far western region of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil, with high risk of CVL outbreaks and presenting a threat to humans.

"Parasites of fishes in the recently inundated ephemeral Lake Liambezi, Namibia","Lake Liambezi forms the periodic connection between the upper Zambezi, Kwando and Okavango rivers. A full parasitological assessment was conducted on 86 fish, representing 14 species in six families sampled in August 2011. Parasite diversity was low and dominated by species with complex life cycles involving intermediate hosts. Most prevalent were larval nematodes (Contracaecum sp.) infecting 12 and Trypanasoma sp. infecting nine of the 14 host species. The intra-erythrocytic parasite Babesiosoma mariae was found in the blood of Coptodon rendalli and Oreochromis andersonii with prevalence of 50% and 60%, respectively. The host-specific monogenean Annulotrema hepseti was recorded only from H. cuvieri with a prevalence of 100%. Notable absences were the copepod and branchiuran parasites that have direct lifecycles and usually occur in high prevalence and abundance in the region. Because parasites with direct life cycles can only be transported into the lake on the host fish, their absence suggests limited immigration of infected fishes into the lake. This suggests that internal recruitment dominates over immigration in the fish population dynamics in Lake Liambezi."
"Risk Factors Associated with Triatomines and Its Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi in Rural Communities from the Southern Region of the State of Mexico, Mexico","Trypanosoma cruzi prevalence in triatomines and risk factors associated to the presence of the insect were studied in 990 rural houses in the southern region of the State of Mexico, Mexico. In each house, triatomines were collected, and information related to house construction material was obtained. 7: cruzi infection was diagnosed in all triatomines. A primary screening was performed using 2 x 2 contingency tables of exposure variables. All variables with P <= 0.20 were analyzed by logistic regression. Triatomines (N = 125) were collected from 822 houses and analyzed for T cruzi infection. Triatoma pallidipennis (97.4%) and Triatoma dimidiata (2.6%) were identified in 52.1% of the localities and in 6.1% of the houses. Infection was found in 28.0% of triatomines, from which 28.9% were nymphs. Factors associated with triatomine infestation were flooring construction material (dirt floor: odds ratio [OR], 10.05; 95% confidence interval [CT], 5.31-18.04; P = 0.0001), house rooms (at least three rooms: OR, 2,04; 95% CI, 1.07-3.86; P = 0.028), and ceiling construction material (cardboard lamina tile: OR, 6.84:95% CI, 1.49-31.31; P = 0.013). This study shows T cruzi circulation in triatomines in the area of study, and because triatomines are adapted for living and reproducing in the domestic environment, there is a potential risk of Chagas disease transmission to humans. Also, we can conclude that the construction materials and house inhabitants are risk factors of triatomines infestation."
Potential animal reservoirs (dogs and bats) of human visceral leishmaniasis due to Leishmania infantum in French Guiana,"In French Guiana, cutaneous leishmaniasis is highly endemic, whereas no autochthonous case of visceral leishmaniasis have been reported so far. However, due to its proximity to Brazil which is highly endemic for visceral leishmaniasis, and the high transboundary population flow, an epidemiological challenge could arise at any time. As an overseas department and region and the largest outermost region of the European Union, epidemiological surveillance of visceral leishmaniasis is of great importance. Our study aimed to investigate the presence of Leishmania spp. in domestic (dogs) and sylvatic (bats) animals from French Guiana. Over the 2008-2018 period, samples from 349 animals were collected. They included blood from 179 autochthonous dogs and 59 bats, spleen samples from 33 bats and, blood from 78 military working dogs (MWD) collected before their departure from continental France and at the end of their four-month stay in French Guiana. Samples were screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays targeting Leishmania DNA followed by sequencing of 18S rRNA, kDNA and ITS2 genes. L. infantum was detected in 2.3% (8/349) of animals with 1.7% (3/179) of autochthonous dogs, 5.1% (4/78) of MWD returning from French Guiana, whereas they were negative before their departure. One of them dates back to 2012. All these dogs were positive for serological tests. In addition, L. infantum DNA was detectable in one bat spleen sample, belonging to Carollia perspicillata species. We report here for the first time an infection with L. infantum in dogs and bat from French Guiana. Our results suggest the existence of potential reservoir and transmission cycle for visceral leishmaniasis, at least since 2012, which was unknown in this territory until now. Further studies are needed to determine how these animals were infected and which vectors are involved in the transmission in this area. Author summary Leishmaniasis is endemic in French Guiana under its cutaneous form where Leishmania guyanensis is the principle parasite species. Visceral leishmaniasis is much more severe, although well known in neighbouring countries (Brazil, Suriname, Venezuela), it has not been known in French Guiana until now. Our study presents the result of a ten-year surveillance of Leishmania spp. infections in dogs and bats from French Guiana. We analyzed 92 bats from French Guiana 179 local dogs and 78 additional French military working dogs (MWD), which spent a short stay in this territory. Globally, we found 2.3% (8/343) of Leishmania infected animals. L. infantum infection was detected in 1.7% (3/179) of autochthonous dogs and 5.1% (4/78) of MWD. One of them dates back to 2012, the others were in 2016 and 2018. Low infection rate was detected in bats, only one specimen among 92 being infected (1.1%) and belonging to Carollia perspicillata species. We conclude that L. infantum has been circulating in French Guiana since at least 2012. Dogs and bats could therefore be among the potential reservoirs. Further investigations on potential additional reservoirs among domestic and wild animals, as well as identification of vectors, are required."
Molecular Evidence of Leishmania infantum and Leishmania guyanensis in Red Howler Monkey (Alouatta seniculus) from French Guiana,"Presence of Leishmania spp. was evaluated in the blood of nine red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) from a specific area of French Guiana, located in the northeast of the Amazon. The molecular detection was performed based on PCR targeting the markers 18S rRNA, kDNA and ITS2 genes, as well as rapid immunomigration tests. Two monkeys were positive for Leishmania infantum and one for Leishmania guyanensis. While L. guyanensis cutaneous leishmaniasis is common, visceral leishmaniasis (human and canine) caused by L. infantum has never been described in this area. The howler monkey proved to be a sentinel and a potential reservoir of a serious zoonosis. These results must be carefully considered by public health officials and veterinarians in the future."
Genotyping of Trypanosoma cruzi in a hyper-endemic area of Colombia reveals an overlap among domestic and sylvatic cycles of Chagas disease,"Background: Chagas disease is a neglected illness caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, which widely affects American communities. This study attempted to identify T. cruzi genotypes circulating in four indigenous communities of the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta, Colombia, to investigate parasite transmission dynamics in these communities. In addition, some epidemiological variables to determine the risk factors for infection with this parasite, such as the prevalence of T. cruzi infection, the triatomine species, and the domestic and sylvatic mammals that act as vectors and reservoirs of the parasite in the domestic, peridomestic and sylvatic cycles, were examined. Methods: We developed a prospective study to identify the main risk factors associated with T. cruzi infection in the region. The T. cruzi prevalence was determined by ELISA, IFA and PCR. Triatomines species and both domestic and sylvatic mammals from all communities were captured and sampled. To analyze parasite transmission dynamics in these four communities, eight DNA parasite probes were generated from insect and reservoir samples, and a DNA blot analysis were carried out. Results: Serological studies revealed 37% prevalence in the four communities, and Kasakumake was the most endemic region, containing approximately 70% seropositives. Moreover, the molecular diagnosis showed a high correlation between the serological data and the T. cruzi circulating in the patients' blood. A total of 464 triatomine insects were collected in domestic, peridomestic and sylvatic environments, and these insects belonged to five different species; Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma dimidiata were the two more important species transmitting the parasite. After studying the eco-epidemiological factors in these four communities, the most important risk factors for infection with the parasite were determined. These risk factors are a high infection rate of people and domestic animals, the construction materials of the houses, the presence of infected triatomines inside the human dwellings, the proximity between houses and a sylvatic environment with several triatomine species and wild animals. Finally, the molecular characterization of T. cruzi showed the presence of three haplotypes and complex T. cruzi mixed infections in all reservoirs. Conclusions: Active transmission of T. cruzi is present in four indigenous communities of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta with overlap between the domestic and the sylvatic transmission cycles of Chagas disease."
Prevalence and Source of Trypanosome Infections in Field-Captured Vector Flies (Glossina pallidipes) in Southeastern Zambia,"The prevalence of trypanosome infections in tsetse flies, Glossina pallidipes, collected front Chiawa and Chakwenga in Zambia with endemic trypanosomosis was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Out of the 550 G. pallidipes, 58 (10.5%) flies were found to harbor trypanosome DNA. Infection rates of tsetse with Trypanosoma vivax universal, Trypanosoma congolense savannah, T congolense forest and T. congolense kilifi were 4.2% (23/550), 4.7% (26/550), 1.1% (6/550) and 1.6% (9/550), respectively. To determine the mammalian hosts of T. congolense and T. vivax infections from the tsetse flies, mammalian mitochondrion DNA of blood meal in these flies were analyzed by PCR and subsequent gene sequence analysis of the amplicons. Sequence analysis showed the presence of cytochrome b gene (cyt b) of 7 different mammalian species such as human, elephant, buffalo, goat, warthog, greater kudu and cattle. Goats which were main livestock in these areas were further examined to know the extent of its contribution ill spreading the infection. We examined the prevalence of trypanosome infections in the domestic goat Population in 6 settlements in Chiawa alone. Of the 86 goats sampled, 4 (4.6%), 5 (5.8%), 4 (4.6%) and 4 (4.6%) were positive for T. vivax universal, T. congolense savannah, forest and kilifi, respectively. These findings showed that the host-source of trypanosome infections in vector fly give a vital information about spread of infection. The result of this study will certainly contribute in elucidating more the epidemiology of trypanosomosis."
Molecular detection of trypanosomes in cattle in South America and genetic diversity of Trypanosoma evansi based on expression-site-associated gene 6,"In South American countries, trypanosomiasis as a result of Trypanosoma evansi and Trypanosoma vivax infections causes significant economic losses in livestock. The objectives of this study were to characterize the epidemiology of bovine trypanosomiasis in South America and to draw a comparison between South American and Asian T. evansi isolates based on the polymorphisms in their transferrin receptor encoding gene 6. We assessed the prevalence rates of T. evansi and T vivax infections in cattle in different regions of Peru and Bolivia using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and found that, in Lima and Pucallpa in the Republic of Peru, T. evansi infection rates were 5.8% (6/104) and 2.5% (5/195), respectively, while in Santa Cruz, Republic of Bolivia, the infection rate for T. evansi was 11.5% (59/510). The prevalence rates of T. vivax in Lima and Santa Cruz were 3.8% (4/104) and 0.9% (5/510), respectively. In T. evansi, uptake of host transferrin is mediated by a receptor derived from the two expression site-associated genes 6 and 7 (ESAG6 and ESAG7). We previously showed that the ESAG6 depicts genetic diversity among different isolates of T. evansi in Asia. In this study, we cloned and sequenced the ESAG6 genes from T evansi isolates from South America, and found, in addition to some of the previously observed variants, 20 novel variants of ESAG6 genes which could be categorized into three new clades among the various isolates. To conclude, the results obtained in this study suggest that T evansi isolates from South America are more diverse than the Asian isolates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Prevalence of Haemoparasites and Associated Risk Factors in Working Donkeys in Adigudem and Kwiha Districts of Tigray Region, Northern Ethiopia","A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2008-March 2009 in Adigudem and Kwiha districts in Tigray regional state, with the objectives of identifying the prevalence of haemoparasites and the associated risk factors in working donkeys. Blood samples were collected from a total 400 randomly selected donkeys and examined by dark ground/phase contrast buffy coat technique and Giemsa stained blood smears. The overall prevalence of haemoparasites was found to be 2.5% (n = 10) without significant variation between the two districts (>0.05). Two genera of haemoparasites namely Babesia and Trypansomes were observed with the prevalence of 1.75% (n = 3), respectively. Two species of Babesia were identified: Babesia equi (71.43%) and Babesia caballi (28.6%) while Trypanosoma vivax was the only trypanosome encountered during the study period. No significant association was observed between the prevalence of either of the two haemoparasites and the hypothesized risk factors (study area, sex, age and body condition score) (p>0.05 for all factors). The mean Packed Cell Volume (PCV) of trypanosome infected donkeys (20.67 +/- 4.04) was significantly (p>0.05) lower than that of non-infected donkeys (28.68 +/- 5.73); however significant difference was observed between Babesia positive and Babesia free animals (p>0.05). In conclusion, the prevalence of haemoparasites observed in the current study is generally low compared to previous studies. As the present study design was a cross-sectional one that only depicts a momentary picture of the infection status in the herd, a further longitudinal study that makes use of molecular techniques is recommended."

"A Cross-Sectional Study of Equine Trypanosomosis and its Vectors in Wolayta Zone, Southern Ethiopia","A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2008-April 2009 in Humbo, Kindo koysha and Sodo zuria districts selected from Wolayta zone located in Southern Ethiopia to investigate the prevalence and species of trypanosomes infecting equines and identify the fly vectors playing a role in the transmission of trypanosomosis. Blood samples were collected from a total of 214 donkeys, 20 horses and 60 mules and examined by dark ground/phase contrast buffy coat technique and Giemsa-stained blood smears. Accordingly, trypanosome species were only encountered in 10.7% of the donkeys (n = 23) while none of the horses and mules examined was positive for trypanosome infection. Two species of trypanosomes were detected in donkeys which in order of predominance were Trypanosoma congolense (52.2%) and Trypanosoma vivax (26.1%) and mixed infection by both species was found in 21.7% of trypanosome-positive animals. Statistical analysis showed no significant association between prevalence of trypanosome infection and the district, Body Condition Score (BCS), age and sex of donkeys (p>0.05 in all cases). There was a highly significant difference (p<0.0001) in mean PCV (%) between trypanosome infected and non infected donkeys. Similarly female animals had significantly lower (p<0.05) mean PCV (%) than male animals. No significant difference (p>0.05) was observed among the mean PCVs of donkeys infected with different species of trypanosomes. The entomological survey revealed the existence of a cyclical vector Glossina pallidipes and other biting flies with a relative proportion of 13.2 and 86.8%, respectively. In conclusion, the prevalence of trypanosomosis obtained in the current study is generally low compared to previous studies and this might be associated with reduction in tsetse density as a result of increased agricultural activities and tsetse control interventions being carried out by governmental and non-governmental organizations in the area."
Bovine Trypanosomiasis an Emerging Disease in Maranhao State-Brazil,"In South American countries, bovine trypanosomiasis is caused mainly by Trypanosoma vivax. Among the infected animals, bovines are considered more susceptible, and this susceptibility varies among breeds. To determine the occurrence of T. vivax in Maranhao State, Brazil, a total of 559 cattle blood samples were collected for molecular and parasitological studies. On Sao Luis Island, no parasites were observed in the parasitological exam; however, with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, three samples (1.06%) were positive. In four municipalities that compose the Pedreiras Basin, 3.39% of the animals were positive on the parasitological exam, and 6.21% of animals were positive by PCR. This finding demonstrates that PCR is more sensitive and confirms that the method is very useful in epidemiological surveys. A further interesting point is that molecular studies clearly define the differences in surface glycoproteins and antigenic variants."
Prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis in A population of free-roaming dogs as determined by multiple sampling efforts: A longitudinal study analyzing the effectiveness of euthanasia,"Free-roaming dogs affected by visceral leishmaniasis (VL) contribute to the geographical expansion of the disease and require special attention from health authorities. The objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalences of VL in a population of free-roaming dogs in an endemic region of Brazil, to establish the spatial distribution of infected dogs, and to examine the effectiveness of euthanasia of infected dogs in controlling the disease in this particular population. Dogs were captured every two months during seven sampling efforts. Capture locations were georeferenced and captured dogs were assessed for the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a screening test and the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) as the confirmatory procedure. Dogs that were seropositive by both assays were considered infected and were submitted to immediate euthanasia. After the end of the collection period, stored sera were evaluated with the Dual-Path Platform test (DPP). Animals positive by this method and by ELISA were also considered infected as currently recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Spatial analysis was performed using the Kernel technique. A total of 328 dogs were captured at least once during the sampling period, 25 (7.6%) of them were seropositive by ELISA and IFAT and 27 (8.2%) by DPP and ELISA. The prevalence of VL showed an overall decreasing trend. However, even with periodical euthanasia, it was not possible to eliminate the infection and increased prevalences were observed in the fourth and seventh samplings. There was a high overall agreement between the two criteria for defining infection. None of the dogs that tested negative by IFAT at the first capture seroconverted in the subsequent captures but a number of dogs exhibited changes in serological status over time. From the three dogs initially tested negative by ELISA and IFAT, but tested positive by the protocol currently adopted in Brazil, two became negative in subsequent recaptures. Spatial analysis revealed that infected animals concentrated in areas with a high density of free-roaming dogs. The existence of VL among homeless dogs may contribute significantly in the persistence of the disease among the human population, despite the practice of periodical euthanasia. The operational and ethical implications associated with euthanasia of free-roaming dogs, and the failure to control the transmission of VL among this particular population, led us to conclude that interventions promoting responsible ownership of pets may be a more effective strategy."
Large pathogen screening reveals first report of Megaselia scalaris (Diptera: Phoridae) parasitizing Apis mellifera intermissa (Hymenoptera: Apidae),"As it is most likely that global warming will also lead to a shift in pollinator-habitats northwards, the study of southern species becomes more and more important. Pathogen screenings in subspecies of Apis mellifera capable of withstanding higher temperatures, provide an insight into future pathogen host interactions. Screenings in different climate regions also provide a global perspective on the prevalence of certain pathogens. In this project, we performed a pathogen screening in Apis mellifera intermissa, a native subspecies of Algeria in northern Africa. Colonies were sampled from different areas in the region of Annaba over a period of two years. Several pathogens were detected, among them Apicystis bombi, Crithidia mellificae, Nosema ceranae, Paenibacillus larvae, Lake Sinai Virus, Sacbrood Virus and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV). Our screening also revealed a phoroid fly, Megaselia scalaris, parasitizing honey bee colonies, which we report here for the first time. In addition, we found DWV to be present in the adult flies and replicating virus in the larval stages of the fly, which could indicate that M. scalaris acts as a vector of DWV. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Epidemiological aspects of canine Chagas disease in the semi-arid region of Paraiba,"In order to determine the epidemiological aspects involving canine Chagas disease (CD) and to identify major risk factors for the disease in the semi-arid region of Paraiba, a study was conducted in the rural area of Patos/Paraiba, Brazil, where the area was divided into three sampling strata (North, South and West) and, in each stratum we randomly sampled about 294 houses, and all the pet dogs represented the elementary units of study. In each household an epidemiological questionnaire was administered to obtain information on indicators that favor the spread of the disease in peridomestic segment. Serological diagnosis for CD in dogs was based on three methods (IFA, ELISA and HAI), considering positive samples that had at least two tests reagents and absence of cross-reaction. For the rural area, the prevalence of seropositive dogs for Trypanosoma cruzi by sampling stratum was: North 6.05%, South 3.59% and West 2.97%, corresponding to a total prevalence of 4.08%. The risk factors (odds ratio, OR) were evidenced in multifactorial analysis: wall type (OR=2.59 [1.24-5.4]), presence at warehouse (OR=1.89 [1.31-3.0]), present at chicken stall (OR=8.31 [1.29-61.7]), contact with animals (OR =9.11 [1.12-73.9]), contact with birds (OR=9.7 [1.81-52.83]), captured triatomines (OR=16.58 [3.43-80.23]) and anthropogenic (OR=4.35 [1.36-14.0]. From the results it was possible to obtain information pertaining to the epidemiological situation of Chagas Disease highlighting biogeographical characteristics of rural semi-arid region of Paraiba, raising dogs and the risk factors disclosed in the highlighted contact with birds and ecotopes operationalizing indicators to be watched and considered in the chain of transmission of the disease in the region."
An Integrated Approach Using Spatial Analysis to Study the Risk Factors for Leishmaniasis in Area of Recent Transmission,"Some epidemiological aspects of leishmaniasis in the municipality of Formiga, Brazil, an important touristic site, were evaluated. Those included phlebotomine sand fly vectors, canine infection, and geoprocessing analysis for determining critical transmission areas. Sand flies (224 insects) belonging to ten different species were captured. The most captured species included Lutzomyia longipalpis (35.3%), Lutzomyia cortelezzii (33.5%), and Lutzomyia whitmani (18.3%). A significant correlation between sand fly densities and climatic conditions was detected. Serological diagnosis ( DPP and ELISA) was performed in 570 dogs indicating a prevalence of 5.8%. After sequencing the main species circulating in the area were Leishmania infantum and Leishmania braziliensis. Spatial analysis demonstrated that vegetation and hydrography may be related to sand fly distribution and infected dogs. The municipality of Formiga has proven leishmaniasis vectors and infected dogs indicating the circulation of the parasite in the city. Correlation of those data with environmental and human cases has identified the critical areas for control interventions ( south, northeast, and northwest). In conclusion, there is current transmission of visceral and canine human cases and the city is on the risk for the appearance of cutaneous cases."
Blood parasites of passerine birds from central Spain,"Sixteen species of passerine birds captured during a 2.5 yr period in Central Spain were examined for hematozoa. Haemoproteus spp., Leucocytozoon spp., Trypanosoma spp., Plasmodium spp., and microfilariae were observed. The most prevalent species were in the genus Leucocytozoon. The majority of the records are new for Spain and some represent new host records. More than one-half of the birds examined were infected with at least one parasite species. These records are similar to those reported from other areas in northern Europe and the Iberian Peninsula."
Diversity and phylogeny of insect trypanosomatids based on small subunit rRNA genes: Polyphyly of Leptomonas and Blastocrithidia,"With the aim of further investigating phylogenetic relationships in insect trypanosomatids, we have determined the sequences of small subunit rRNA genes from ten isolates, which were originally classified as Leptomonas. Blastocrithidia, and Wallaceina based on their morphology in the hosts. The inferred maximum likelihood, parsimony, and distance trees indicate that the Leptomonas and Blastocrithidia are polyphyletic, and confirm the polyphyly of Herpetomonas and Crithidia. Blastocrithidia triatoma and Leptomonas collosoma were among the earliest branching lineages among the insect trypanosomatids. while most other isolates were found within a closely related terminal clade, which also included Crithidia fasciculata. This analysis has clearly demonstrated that the morphological classification system of insect trypanosomatids does not always reflect their genetic affinities warranting its revision in the future."
Canine leishmaniosis in Central Europe: Retrospective survey and serological study of imported and travelling dogs,
"Widespread Trypanosoma cruzi infection in government working dogs along the Texas-Mexico border: Discordant serology, parasite genotyping and associated vectors","Background Chagas disease, caused by the vector-borne protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is increasingly recognized in the southern U.S. Government-owned working dogs along the Texas-Mexico border could be at heightened risk due to prolonged exposure outdoors in habitats with high densities of vectors. We quantified working dog exposure to T. cruzi, characterized parasite strains, and analyzed associated triatomine vectors along the Texas-Mexico border. Methodology/Principle findings In 2015-2016, we sampled government working dogs in five management areas plus a training center in Texas and collected triatomine vectors from canine environments. Canine serum was tested for anti-T. cruzi antibodies with up to three serological tests including two immunochromatographic assays (Stat-Pak and Trypanosoma Detect) and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. The buffy coat fraction of blood and vector hindguts were tested for T. cruzi DNA and parasite discrete typing unit was determined. Overall seroprevalence was 7.4 and 18.9% (n = 528) in a conservative versus inclusive analysis, respectively, based on classifying weakly reactive samples as negative versus positive. Canines in two western management areas had 2.6-2.8 (95% CI: 1.0-6.8 p = 0.02-0.04) times greater odds of seropositivity compared to the training center. Parasite DNA was detected in three dogs (0.6%), including TcI and TcI/TcIV mix. Nine of 20 (45%) T. gerstaeckeri and T. rubida were infected with TcI and TcIV; insects analyzed for bloodmeals (n = 11) fed primarily on canine (54.5%). Conclusions/Significance Government working dogs have widespread exposure to T. cruzi across the Texas-Mexico border. Interpretation of sample serostatus was challenged by discordant results across testing platforms and very faint serological bands. In the absence of gold standard methodologies, epidemiological studies will benefit from presenting a range of results based on different tests/interpretation criteria to encompass uncertainty. Working dogs are highly trained in security functions and potential loss of duty from the clinical outcomes of infection could affect the work force and have broad consequences."
"Natural infection with Leishmania infantum chagasi in Lutzomyia (Lutzomyia) longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae) sandflies captured in the municipality of Janauba, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil","Introduction: Visceral leishmaniasis has been notified in nearly all states of Brazil, and particularly in the north of Minas Gerais, where the disease is endemic. The aim of this study was to detect natural infection of Lutzomyia longipalpis and, through the PCR/RFLP technique, identify Leishmania species found in sandflies in the municipality of Janauba. Methods: Using light traps, 1,550 females of L. longipalpis were caught and grouped into pools of 10 specimens to be subjected to DNA extraction and amplification, by means of generic PCR and cacophony. Results: Out of the 155 pools, six were positive for Leishmania sp., and thus the infection rate in the municipality was 3.9%. Through PCR/RFLP, the digestion pattern among the positive samples was found to be similar to that of the reference strain of Leishmania chagasi (MHOM/BR/74/PP75). Conclusions: The detection of natural infection associated with studies on the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis suggests that L. longipalpis is involved in transmission of L. infantum chagasi in Janauba, particularly in areas of intense transmission of visceral leishmaniasis."
Bovine Trypanosomosis in three districts of East Gojjam Zone bordering the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia,"Background: Bovine trypanosomosis is a serious constraint to agricultural production in extensive areas of Ethiopia. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of bovine infection with trypanosomes and to identify the prevailed trypanosome species in three districts of the East Gojjam zone bordering the Blue Nile River from March 2005 to February 2006. Cattle from 9 different localities were checked using microscopical examination of wet blood smears, thin and stained bloodsmears, and by blood centrifugation followed by the examination of the resultant buffy coats. Result: Of the total 3,360 cattle investigated, 8.2% (3.5%, 11.6% and 9.4% from Dejen, Machakel and Baso-Liben districts respectively) were found to be infected with trypanosomes. Of the total 275 positive animals, 249 (90.5%) appeared to be infected with Trypanosoma vivax; 11 (4%) were infected with T. congolense; and 15 (5.5%) were infected with mixed infection of T. vivax and T. congolense. The prevalence of infection with T. vivax was significantly higher than that of T. congolense (P <0.001). Taking 24-46% as normal PCV value, the mean PCV for the trypanosome-infected cattle (22.09%) was lower than those for the trypanosome-negative animals (26.03). Conclusion: Trypanosomosis is a disease of considerable importance to the major economic districts bordering the Blue Nile River of the East Gojjam zone, Ethiopia, given the disease's potential to threaten the health and productivity of cattle in this region."
"Molecular investigation of vector-borne parasites in wild micromammals, Barcelona (Spain)","Information about the role of micromammals in the epidemiology of Leishmania infantum and Babesia sp. in southern Europe is scarce. Wild micromammals were captured in natural areas in the Barcelona province (NE Spain) in 2011 and analysed by real-time PCR for the presence of DNA of Piroplasmida (n = 253) and Leishmania infantum (n = 166). The wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) was the most abundant species, but all specimens tested negative for L. infantum, for which two out of 15 (13.3%) white-toothed shrews (Crocidura russula) and one out of 23 (4.3%) Algerian mice (Mus spretus) resulted positive. No individual was positive for Piroplasmida DNA. The role of wild micromammals in the epidemiology of these parasites in the study area seems negligible."
Frequency of infection of Lutzomyia phlebotomines with Leishmania braziliensis in a Brazilian endemic area as assessed by pinpoint capture and polymerase chain reaction,"Leishmania infected of Lutzomyia spp. are rare in endemic areas. We tested the hypothesis that there is clustering of infected vectors by combining pinpoint capture with sensitive L. braziliensis kDNA minicircle specific PCR/dot blot in an endemic area in the State of Bahia. Thirty, out of 335 samples (10 to 20 sand flies/sample; total of 4,027 female sand flies) were positive by PCR analysis and dot blot leading to a underestimated overall rate of 0.4% positive phlebotomines. However, 83.3% of the positive samples were contributed by a single sector out of four sectors of the whole studied area. This resulted in a rate of 1.5% Leishmania positive phlebotomines for this sector, far above rates of other sectors. Incidence of American cutaneous leishmaniasis cases for this sector was about twice that for other sectors. Our results show that there is a non-homogeneous distribution of Leishmania-infected vectors. Such a clustering may have implications in control strategies against leishmaniasis, and reinforces the necessity of understanding the ecological and geographical factors involved in leishmanial transmission."
First description of naturally acquired Tritrichomonas foetus infection in a Persian cattery in Spain,"Tritrichomonas foetus has been identified as the causative agent of feline intestinal trichomonosis, characterized by clinical signs of chronic large bowel diarrhoea. This disease has been reported in cats from the USA, Europe and Australia. However, its epidemiology is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to describe T. foetus infection in a Persian cattery in Spain. T. foetus infection was sequentially diagnosed in 20 cats by direct faecal smear examined under the microscope, specific culture (In Pouch TF medium) and PCR. A standard coprological sedimentation method was also performed in order to screen for other intestinal parasites in all the cats included. In addition, sera were tested for IgG antibodies against Leishmania infantum, Toxoplasma gondii, and for the detection of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). Five out of 20 cats were positive for T. foetus (25%), two of them by microscopy, culture and PCR and three by culture and PCR. No association was found between T. foetus infection and age or sex. L. infantum and T. gondii seroprevalence rates were 15% and 10%, respectively. The prevalence of FeLV p27 antigen and of FIV antibodies in the study population was zero. Cystoisospora spp. oocysts were detected in one cat. These preliminary results show that the transmission of T. foetus infection in cluster conditions may occur between asymptomatic cats and young or immunocompromised animals."
A leishmaniosis surveillance system among stray dogs in the region of Madrid: ten years of serodiagnosis (1996-2006),"Two seroepidemiological surveys on canine leishmaniosis in stray dogs were performed annually in the Madrid region for 10 years (November 1996-April 2006). The presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies was detected by immunofluorescence antibodies test (cut off 1:100). The overall seroprevalence found in the 1,803 dogs studied was 7.8% (141 positive dogs). Seropositivity was not associated with either breed or sex. Statistical analysis revealed greater seroprevalence in groups of older dogs, indicating that the probability of exposure to the bite of sand flies infected with Leishmania infantum increased with age. The most important result was a high proportion of seropositivity for leishmaniosis (79.5%) among dogs without clinical signs of canine leishmaniosis. These data are very important because stray dogs can play an important role in the epidemiology of this zoonotic disease. Furthermore, the stray population could be useful sentinels to follow the progress of the disease in endemic areas."
"Isolation and detection of Leishmania species among naturally infected Rhombomis opimus, a reservoir host of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in Turkemen Sahara, North East of Iran","In Iran, three species of Leishmania have been incriminated as the causative agents of human leishmaniasis, Leishmania (L) major, Leishmania tropica, and Leishmania infantum. Rhombomis opimus have been incriminated as a principal reservoirs of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania major, the causative agent of rural zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) in Iran. Rodents captured and examined to find Leishmania species using conventional methods including direct impression smear and microscopic observation, inoculation samples to Balb/c and culture in NNN medium. Also molecular method was employed to detect Leishmania in rodents by amplifying a region of the ribosomal RNA amplicon of Leishmania (ITSI-5.85 rRNA-ITS2) using Nested PCR. Leshmania species were specified by DNA sequences. 36(38.3%) of R. opimus were Leishmania positive using at least one conventional methods. Many more ITS-rDNA fragments were amplified from R. opimus but only 65 out of 74 PCR products contained enough DNA for direct sequencing or readable sequences. The PCR assays detected in Iranian R. opimus not only Leishmania major in 59(79.7%) rodents but also Leishmania turanica in 6(8.1%) rodents, another parasite of the great gerbil. These parasites were found in Turkemen Sahara, North East of Iran, in a focus of rural (ZCL). L major and L turanica in R. opimus firmly identified from Turkemen Sahara. Nine rodents with Leishmania infections unidentified which some were unreadable sequences, these could be mixed infections of L major, L turanica, Leishmania gerbilli sensu lato and Leishmania close to L gerbilli or a related species reported in sandflies previously from this location. The haplotypes of L major and L. turanica were found to be identical to that of isolates of L. major and L turanica from Iran and in GenBank elsewhere. R. opimus is probably the key reservoir in this ZCL. focus because of its abundance and its infection rates with both L major and L. turanica. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"4 NEW TRYPANOSOMES (PROTOZOA, TRYPANOSOMATIDAE) IN THE BLOOD OF A MALAYSIAN FROG, RANA-BLYTHI (AMPHIBIA, RANIDAE)","Four new amphibian trypanosomes, Trypanosoma midaii, Trypanosoma ampanense, Trypanosoma maleisiense, and Trypanosoma bulat were described in the blood of a Malaysian frog, Rana blythi from Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. We examined 190 individuals of the frog and in addition to four new species, we also detected Trypanosoma rotatorium-type and Trypanosoma chattoni-type. The prevalence of all six species of trypanosomes in R. blythi in Malaysia was summarized and discussed."
"Community perceptions of important camel diseases in Lapur Division of Turkana District, Kenya","This paper presents the results of a study conducted in Lapur Division of Turkana District, Kenya, to estimate the incidence and mortality of camel trypanosomosis using participatory methods. Four livestock camps ('adakars') were conveniently selected for the study. Four informant groups comprising 6-8 key persons were used for the participatory exercises. The camel diseases identified by the pastoralists in their order of importance according to annual incidence were: trypanosomosis (11.4%); mange (10.8%); tick infestation (7.9%); haemorrhagic septicaemia (7.7%); and non-specific diarrhoea (7.6%). Almost half (49.3%) of the camel population suffered from at least one disease over the previous year. The annual incidence and mortality rates of trypanosomosis were estimated at 15% and 9.9% in adult camels and 6.9% and 5.2% in young camels, respectively. There was a seasonal occurrence of trypanosomosis, with most cases reported in the dry season. The prevalence levels of the disease reportedly declined from about 100% in 1978 to an almost stable state of about 15% in 2002. This study revealed that camel trypanosomosis is still an important disease in Turkana District, exacting a heavy toll in terms of morbidity and mortality. The economic losses due to the disease were likely to have been great owing to the central role the camel plays in this arid district of Kenya."
The PCR-based detection of Leishmania major infections in Meriones libycus (Rodentia : Muridae) from southern Iran,"Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an increasing public-health problem in the countries of the Mediterranean region. In southern Iran, for example, the incidence of CL has more than doubled over the last decade. As part of an investigation of this worrying trend, the leishmanial infections of the wild rodents that may act as reservoir hosts were investigated in the Iranian province of Fars. Overall, 82 rodents, 56 of them Libyan jirds (Meriones libycus), were collected, in live traps, from a new, hypo-endemic focus of zoonotic CL. When Giemsa-stained smears of ear tissue or any lesions on the rodents were prepared and checked under a light microscope, amastigotes were found in the smears from six of the rodents, all M. libycus. None of the other rodents investigated was found to be infected. The infected rodents were encountered in two of the three areas studied. In PCR-based assays, the amastigotes seen in the ear smears and those from two recent human cases of CL from the focus were all found to be identical to a reference strain of L. major. It therefore seems that M. libycus is the main active reservoir host for ZCL in the focus."
Epidemiological aspects of canine visceral leishmaniosis in the Islamic Republic of Iran,"An epidemiological study to examine the sero-prevalence of zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis (ZVL) among domestic and wild canines in endemic foci of Iran was carried out during 1999-2003 to assess the distribution of the disease and the possible association between infection in dogs, wild canines and people. Anti-leishmanial antibodies were detected by the direct agglutination test (DAT). Parasitological study was performed for all captured wild canines and were detected in some of the seropositive dogs with specific clinical signs (n = 107). Serum samples (n = 1568) were collected from domestic dogs in villages that are known endemic foci of human visceral leishmaniosis (HVL). Wild canine sera were collected from jackals (Canis aureus, n = 10), foxes (Vulpes vulpes, n = 10) and wolves (Canis lupus, n = 10). Of the 1568 serum sampled collected from domestic dogs, 222 (14.2%) were positive by DAT (1:320 and above). No statistically significant difference was found between male (15.2%) and female (11.8%) sero-prevalence (P = 0.083). Dogs of 8 years and above showed the highest sero-prevalence (40.6%). Only 23.9% of the seropositive domestic dogs had clinical signs. Parasitology and serology tests that were performed in 30 wild canines showed 10% these animals were infected by Leishmania infantum. Ten out of 11 Leishmania spp. isolated from the dogs and wild canines were identified as L infantum and one other as L. tropica by molecular and biochemical techniques. For the first time in Iran, L. infantum and L. tropica were isolated from viscera of both a wolf and a domestic dog. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma evansi in dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius) from the Canary Islands (Spain) using an antibody Ab-ELISA,"After the description in Grand Canary Island of a case of dromedary trypanosomosis caused by Trypanosoma evansi in 1998, an indirect enzyme immunoassay for the detection of specific anti-T. evansi IgG (Ab-ELISA) was used to assess the seroprevalence of this disease on the Canary islands, Seroprevalence was 9.0% in the four studied islands (Gran Canaria, Tenerife, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura), varying from 10.0 to 7.5% by island (not significantly different). Prevalence using Ab-ELISA was higher than that observed when a parasitological method (microscopic observation of blood smears) was used (1.3%). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
"Trypanosomatids (Protozoa: Kinetoplastida) in three species of Armored Catfish from Mogi-Guacu river, Pirassununga, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Trypanosome infections have been reported in several species of fish, in majority of cases described on the basis of morphological characteristics. Trypanosomes in fish are heteroxenous and transmitted by hirudineans. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence and density of infections by Trypanosoma sp. in blood from three species of catfish, Hypostomus regani, H. strigaticeps, H. albopunctatus, from the Mogi Guacu River, Pirassununga, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Further, this study intends to characterize the Trypanosoma specimens found in the blood of these fish by morphological and molecular techniques. The trypanosomes overall prevalence observed was 47.6% with a general average density of 0.75 parasites/mu l of blood. Hypostomus regani and Hypostomus strigaticeps showed a significant difference in prevalence. The average densities of parasites were not significantly different among the three fish species. Similar findings were observed for the monthly variations in densities. The parasites found in the three species of catfish studied showed similar morphological characteristics. The morphological data and the statistical analyses used in this study didn't show the formation of groups. The analyses provided evidence of the presence of pleomorphisms in the trypanosomes found in the three studied fish."
"Trypanosoma cruzi in triatomines from Nuevo Leon, Mexico","Objective. To determine the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi in triatomines from Nuevo Leon using the standardization of an improved enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. Materials and Methods. From July to September 2005, 52 triatomines were captured in General Teran, a municipality located in Nuevo Leon. They were analyzed using optical microscopy (OM) and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as standards of reference, to develop a technique for detecting the parasite using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results. Using OM and PCR, 31 triatomines were found to be positive and 21 negative. Using ELISA, 27 samples were identified as positive and 25 negative (specificity 100%, sensitivity 87%, negative predictive value 84%, and positive predictive value 100%). The prevalence of infected triatomines was 59.61% with OM and PCR, and 51.92% with ELISA. Our data confirm that the ELISA assay in triatomines is a fast, reliable and useful tool. Conclusions. Since it was possible to simultaneously analyze a large number of samples with high sensibility and specificity values, the ELISA test proves to be useful for new epidemiologic studies having a high number of vectors. It is also less expensive than PCR. It is therefore recommended for epidemiological and preventive surveillance programs as a first screening test before conducting a confirmatory test using PCR."
"Epidemiology of Chagas disease in Guatemala: Infection rate of Triatoma dimidiata, Triatoma nitida and Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) with Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma rangeli (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae)","A five-year domiciliary collection in the 22 departments of Guatemala showed that out of 4,128 triatomines collected, 1,675 were Triatoma dimidiata (Latreille, 1811), 2,344 were Rhodnius prolixus Stal 1859, and only 109 were T. nitida Usinger 1939. The Chagas disease parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, was found in all three species. Their natural infection rates were similar in the first two species (20.6%; 19.1%) and slightly lower in T. nitida (13.8%). However there was no significant difference in the infection rates in the three species (p = 0.131). T. dimidiata males have higher infection rates than females (p = 0.030), whereas for R. prolixus there is no difference in infection rates between males and females (p = 0.114). The sex ratios for all three species were significantly skewed. More males than females were found inside houses for T. dimidiata (p < 0.0001) and T. nitida (p = 6.011); a different pattern was seen for R. prolixus (p = 0.037) where more females were found. Sex ratio is proposed as an index to show the mobility of T. dimidiata in different populations. T. dimidiata is widely distributed in the country, and is also the main vector in at least ten departments, but R. prolixus with higher vectorial capacity is an important vector in at least two departments."
"Visceral leishmaniasis: a study on phlebotomine sand flies and canine infection in Montes Claros, State of Minas Gerais","Visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil was initially associated with rural areas. However, due to several environmental modi cations such as deforestation, urbanization and intense migratory processes, there has been an expansion of endemic areas, leading to urbanization of the disease, mainly in the central and northeastern regions of Brazil. In the municipality of Montes Claros, located in the north of the state of Minas Gerais, an epidemiological survey on VL was carried out. A canine serological inquiry was carried out in 2002 and an entomological survey, using luminous CDC traps, was performed from September 2002 to August 2003. Canine VL prevalence showed an average infection rate of approximately 5 %. An estimated 16 species comprised the phlebotomine sand fly fauna, based on a total of 1043 specimens. The predominant species was Lutzomyia longipalpis with a rate of 74 %, suggesting its participation in the transmission of VL in the municipality of Montes Claros."
Chagas disease in dogs from endemic areas of Costa Rica,"Dogs with the presumptive diagnosis of Chagas disease are commonly sent to our School of Veterinary Medicine by independent veterinarians. This prompted its to evaluate the prevalence of canine trypanosomiasis in some villages of the Central Valley of Costa Rica. A total of 54 dogs (21 males and 33 females) from five rural villages, with ages between 3 months anti 10 years old, were bled and submitted to three serological tests indirect immunofluorescence, indirect hemagglutination and ELISA. Among all animals, 15 (27.7%) revealed antibodies (6 pure bred and 9 mongrels) and in 3 of them the parasite was also demonstrated by xenodiagnosis. All positive animals except 1, and 9 negative animals (control group) were examined by X-rays and electrocardiography revealing different degrees of cardiomegaly, and ECG alteration, consistent with Chagas disease pathology in one dog (SA-11) of the infected ones. Examination of 50 inhabitants living in the houses where dogs and Triatoma dimidiata were found, yielded negative serological reactions. This was assumed to support the hypothesis that clogs are commonly infected by the oral route, a more effective means of infection compared with the vector transmission mechanism that occurs in humans."
"Spatial distribution and infection rate of leishmaniasis vectors (Diptera: Psychodidae) in Ardabil Province, Northwest of Iran","Objective: To determine the spatial distribution and infection rate of sand flies as vectors of Leishmania parasite in Ardabil province, northwest of Iran. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. The sand flies were collected from 30 areas in all 10 districts of Ardabil province during 2017. The specimens were caught using the sticky traps. The head and genitalia of sand flies were separated and mounted in Berlese solution for microscopic identification. The Geographical Information System ArcMap10.4.1 software was used to provide the spatial maps. Results: A total of 2 794 sand flies specimens were collected and 22 species of sand flies were identified from the two genera: Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia from Ardabil province. The highest frequency was found in Phlebotomus papatasi (23.7%) followed by Phlebotomus kandelakii (13.0%). The promastigote form of Leishmania infantum parasite has been reported from the three main vectors of visceral leishmaniasis (Phlebotomus kandelakii, Phlebotomus perfiliewi and Phlebotomus tobbi) from Ardabil province, where the spatial distribution map of these visceral leishmaniasis vectors was prepared. Some important species of sand flies such as Phlebotomus kandelakii, Phlebotomus perfiliewi and Phlebotomus tobbi were reported and identified as main and probable vectors of visceral leishmaniasis in Ardabil. Conclusions: According to the Geographic Information System based maps, the frequency of the sand flies as leishmaniasis vectors, the leishmania parasite infection rate and the prevalence of the disease in the central areas of Ardabil province are higher than in other areas in Ardabil province."
Prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi and Other Trypanosomatids in Frequently-Hunted Wild Mammals from the Peruvian Amazon,"To better understand the ecology of Trypanosoma cruzi in the northeastern Peruvian Amazon, we evaluated the prevalence of T. cruzi and other trypanosomatids in four orders of wild mammals hunted and consumed by inhabitants of three remote indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Of 300 wild mammals sampled, 115 (38.3%) were infected with trypanosomatids and 15 (5.0%) with T. cruzi. The prevalence of T. cruzi within each species was as follows: large rodents (Cuniculus paca, 5.5%; Dasyprocta spp., 2.6%), edentates (Dasypus novemcinctus, 4.2%), and carnivores with higher prevalence (Nasua nasua, 18.8%). The high prevalence of T. cruzi and other trypanosomatids in frequently hunted wild mammals suggests a sizeable T. cruzi sylvatic reservoir in remote Amazonian locations."
Exposure of client-owned cats to zoonotic vector-borne pathogens: Clinic-pathological alterations and infection risk analysis,"Zoonotic Vector-Borne Diseases (VBDs) represent a relevant health issue for pets and humans. Italy is a major epidemiological hub for feline VBDs, because of suitable conditions for vector biology and disease transmission patterns. The present study investigated the exposure to major zoonotic arthropod-borne pathogens of cats in Italy, along with the evaluation of clinic-pathological features and a risk factor analysis. Out of 167 examined cats, 52 (31.1%) were seropositive for at least one vector-borne pathogen, being positivity for Bartonella henselae the most recorded (18%). Also, various cats seroreacted for Rickettsia fells (10.8%) and Rickettisa typhi (4.2%), Leishmania infanturn (3%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (2.4%) and Ehrlichia cans (2.4%). Forty-six cats were tested also for antibodies against D. immitis and two (4.3%) scored positive. The statistical analysis showed a positive association between flea infestation and seropositivity to B. henselae, other than an association between the administration of monthly ectoparasiticide treatments and seronegativity for Rickettsia spp.; seropositive cats were older than negative animals and the lifestyle (i.e. indoor vs outdoor) was not correlated with exposure to vector-borne pathogens. The majority of seropositive cats appeared clinically healthy or showed aspecific clinical signs. Around 80% of seropositive cats had one or more biochemical and/or complete blood count abnormalities. The present data confirm the endemicity of zoonotic feline VBDs in Italy and indicate that awareness on arthropod infections and transmitted pathogens should be kept high and possible implemented, towards the protection of animal and human health with adequate surveillance plans."
Detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies in sylvatic lagomorphs from an epidemic area of Madrid using the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test,
Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and vector control activities in rural communities of the southern Gran Chaco (Argentina),"We compared age-related seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection with history of vector control interventions and social and ecological changes in three historically endemic departments of Cordoba province, Argentina, covering an area of 42,600 km(2) of the Gran Chaco region. Using a cross sectional design, blood samples of 5240 people between 6 months and 40 years of age, living in 192 rural communities were analyzed to detect T. cruzi infection using ELISA tests, and confirmed with indirect immunofluorescent antibody test and indirect haemoagglutination. Overall seroprevalence was 5.4%, 7.9% and 7.5% in the north, northwest and west studied areas (average for all areas 6.95%). Seroprevalence for T cruzi increased with population age, especially in age classes older than 15 years of age. Communities of the north and west areas showed 0.59% seroprevalence for T. cruzi in children below 15 years of age, whereas children of the same age in the northwest region showed a seroprevalence of 3.08%. Comparative analyses indicate that vector control activities and land use changes during the last decades are the most likely causes of the overall reduction of T. cruzi prevalence. Results suggest that the vectorial transmission of T. cruzi has been strongly reduced and probably interrupted in the north and west areas, but it is still active in the northwestern rural settlements of Cordoba province.

Chagas disease in indigenous communities of the Impenetrable Chaqueno Forest,
Emerging feline vector-borne pathogens in Italy,"BackgroundThe epidemiology of feline vector-borne pathogens (FeVBPs) has been less investigated in cats than in dogs. The present study assessed the prevalence of Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Cytauxzoon spp. and Leishmania infantum infections in cat populations living in central Italy, by molecular and serological tools.ResultsA total of 286 healthy cats were randomly selected from catteries and colonies in central Italy. Peripheral blood and conjunctival swab (CS) samples were collected during surgical procedures for regional neutering projects. Sera were analysed by IFAT to detect anti-Rickettsia felis, R. conorii, Babesia microti and Leishmania IgG antibodies using commercial and home-made antigens. DNA extracted from buffy coats (BCs) was tested for Rickettsia spp., and Piroplasmida species, including Cytauxzoon spp. and Babesia spp. by PCR. Buffy coats and CS samples were assayed by a nested (n)-PCR for Leishmania spp. Sixty-two cats (21.67%) were seropositive to at least one of the tested pathogens. The serological assay revealed 23 (8.04%) and 18 (6.29%) positive cats for R. felis and R. conorii, respectively, with low titers (1/64-1/128). No antibodies against B. microti were detected. Neither Rickettsia nor Piroplasmida DNA were amplified using the specific PCR assays. Thirty-one cats (10.83%) tested positive to anti-Leishmania IgG, with titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:160 and 45 animals (15.73%) tested positive to Leishmania CS n-PCR, whereas none of the animals tested positive to BC n-PCR. Considering the results obtained by IFAT and CS n-PCR, a moderate agreement between the two tests was detected (=0.27).ConclusionsThe results of the serological and molecular surveys showed a moderate exposure to Leishmania in the investigated cats and highlighted the limited molecular diagnostic value of BC versus CS samples for this pathogen. Conversely no evidence supported the circulation of Cytauxzoon spp. in domestic cats, in contrast with previous detections in European wild cats in the same areas monitored. The low positive titres for R. felis in association with no DNA BC amplification prevent speculation on the exposure of feline populations to this FeVBP due to the cross-reactivity existing within spotted fever group rickettsiosis (SFGR)."
Molecular detection of protozoan parasites infecting Apis mellifera colonies in Japan,"The role of protozoan parasites in honey bee health and distribution in the world is not well understood. Therefore, we carried out a molecular survey for the presence of Crithidia mellificae and Apicystis bombi in the colonies of both non-native Apis mellifera and native Apis cerana japonica in Japan. We found that A.mellifera, but not A.c.japonica, colonies are parasitized with C.mellificae and A.bombi. Their absence in A.c.japonica colonies indicates that A.mellifera is their native host. Nevertheless, the prevalence in A.mellifera colonies is low compared with other pathogens such as viruses and Nosema microsporidia. Japanese C.mellificae isolates share well-conserved nuclear-encoded gene sequences with Swiss and US isolates. We have found two Japanese haplotypes (A and B) with two nucleotide differences in the kinetoplast-encoded cytochrome b sequence. The haplotype A is identical to Swiss isolate. These results demonstrate that C.mellificae and A.bombi distribute in Asia, Oceania, Europe, and South and North Americas."
Characterization of trypanosome infections by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification in wild tsetse flies in Cameroon,"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to characterize trypanosome infections in tsetse flies from 3 sleeping sickness foci in Cameroon. The predominant tsetse species found was Glossina palpalis palpalis. An average infection rate of 12.1% was revealed by microscopical examination of 888 non-teneral tsetse flies. PCR amplification analyses for trypanosome identification were carried out on 467 flies, with primer sets specific for Trypanosoma( Trypanozoon) brucei s.l., T. (Duttonella) vivax, T. (Nannomonas) simiae and forest type T. (Nannomonas) congolense. Of 467 flies 93 were positive by microscopical analysis while PCR succeeded in identifying 89 positive flies. Of the PCR-positive flies 34 (38.2%) were negative by microscopical examination. PCR amplification, when compared to the parasitological technique, gave a higher estimate of infection rate of trypanosomes in natural tsetse populations. The PCR technique did, however, fail to identify 40.9 % (38/93) of the parasitologically positive flies. The reasons for this failure are discussed. The overall prevalence of mixed infections, assessed by PCR, was 37.1 %; the majority (727 %) involved T. brucei and forest type T. congolense."
Detection and identification of trypanosomes by polymerase chain reaction in wild tsetse flies in Cameroon,"The prevalence of various species and subgroups of trypanosomes in infected flies from three sleeping sickness foci in Cameroon was determined by the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The predominant tsetse species found were Glossina palpalis palpalis. Microscopical examination of 943 non-teneral tsetse flies revealed an average infection rate of 10.4%. A total of 90 flies were analyzed for trypanosome identification with primer sets specific for Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) brucei s.l., T. (Duttonella) vivax, T. (Nannomonas) simiae, and forest type T. (Nannamonas) congolense. PCR succeeded in identifying 52 of the 90 infected flies. Other primers were also tested on microscope positive/PCR-negative infections, and trypanosome subgroups were detected (Kilifi type and savannah type T. congolense). PCR amplification allowed identification of immature infections and revealed mixed-infections. The PCR technique failed to identify 42.2% (38/90) of the parasitologically positive flies and the reasons for this failure are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
Trypanosoma vivax is the second leading cause of camel trypanosomosis in Sudan after Trypanosoma evansi,"Background: This study was conducted in response to recurring reports from eastern Sudan of camel trypanosomosis that can no longer be treated by currently available trypanocidal drugs. One hundred and eighty-nine blood samples were obtained from camels in different herds and local markets in the western part of Sudan, and a cross-sectional study was carried out between December 2015 and February 2016 to identify the causative agents and possible circulating genotypes. Results: The prevalence of trypanosomes detected using the conventional parasitological techniques of Giemsa-stained blood smears, wet blood smears and the microhematocrit centrifugation technique (MHCT) was 7% (13/189), 11% (21/189) and 19% (36/189), respectively. However, a multi-species KIN-PCR targeting the ITS region revealed that the prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi was 37% (70/189), while that of T. vivax was 25% (47/189). Consequently, we used a T. evansi-specific PCR (RoTat1.2 VSG gene) to analyse the KIN-PCR-positive samples and a T. vivax-specific PCR (Cathepsin L-like gene) to analyse all of the samples. The prevalence of T. evansi was 59% (41/70), while the prevalence of T. vivax was 31% (59/189). Mixed infections were detected in 18% (34/189) of the samples. These results were further confirmed by sequencing and a phylogenetic analysis of the complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of T. evansi and the TviCatL gene of T. vivax. Conclusion: We conclude that T. vivax was newly introduced to the camel population and that T. evansi is no longer the single cause of camel trypanosomosis in Sudan. The presence of T. vivax in camels detected in this study is a challenge in the choice of diagnostic approaches, particularly serology, and PCRs. However, an analysis of drug resistance should be performed, and the genotypic variation should be verified. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular study on T. vivax and mixed-infection with T. vivax and T. evansi in Sudanese camels."
The incrimination of three trypanosome species in clinically affected German shepherd dogs in Sudan,"Canine trypanosomosisis (CT) is a common disease caused by tsetse- and non-tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes worldwide. The severity of the disease varies from acute, sub-acute to chronic with non-specific clinical signs. Here, we attempt in a cross-sectional study to assess the current situation of CT and the role of dogs in transmitting trypanosomes to other domesticated animals. The study was carried out during July 2016 on 50 caged German shepherd dogs in Khartoum State to investigate the prevalence of dog trypanosomosis using both serological (CATT/Trypanosoma evansi) and molecular (KIN-PCR, RoTat1.2 VSG-PCR and TviCatL-PCR) tests to detect possible trypanosome infections. CATT/T. evansi detected antibodies against T. evansi in 15 (30%) dogs, while parasite DNA was detected in 17 (34%) dogs by RoTat1.2 PCR. In contrast, a KIN-PCR detected the subgenus Trypanozoon, Trypanosoma congolense savannah, T. congolense Kenya and T. vivax in 36 (72%), 3 (6%), 1 (2%), and 2 (4%) dogs, respectively. However, a species-specific PCR for Trypanosoma vivax was detected 7 (14%) positive cases. We concluded that CT was caused by at least three species of trypanosomes, namely T. evansi, T. vivax and T. congolense. Trypanozoon other than T. evansi could not be ruled out since other tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes have also been detected and species-specific PCRs were not used. This study illustrates that dogs play an important role in the transmission dynamic and the epidemiology of the abovementioned trypanosome species."
"First Detection of Leishmania major in Rattus norvegicus from Fars Province, Southern Iran","Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is an important health problem in Iran and a great economic burden on the health resources. In southern Iran (Fars Province), Meriones libycus was reported as the main reservoir of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in Arsanjan and Marvdasht cities, and Tatera indica and Gerbillus spp. were the reservoirs reported in Larestan and Kharameh districts. Because of an increase in human cutaneous leishmaniasis in Fars Province, this study was performed to identify the rodent hosts in this region. From April 2004 to April 2006, live traps were used to catch rodents in different parts of Fars Province. Fifty-seven Rattus norvegicus were caught and checked for Leishmania infection using a combination of microscopy, culture, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme electrophoresis. One female R. norvegicus was found to be smear positive for amastigotes in Giemsa-stained skin sample of sole, and it was also culture positive for Leishmania. Results of PCR and isoenzyme electrophoresis indicated that this infected rodent was harboring Leishmania major. PCR was also positive for L. major in biopsy of soles, ear, liver, and spleen of 29 other R. norvegicus hosts that were negative in smears and cultures. There were no lesions seen in any parts of infected rodents' bodies. As L. major has not been previously reported in R. norvegicus in Iran or elsewhere, the rodent can be considered as a possible reservoir in transmission of the disease in Fars Province, and it should be brought into consideration when planning for preventive measures."
Factors Associated With Peridomestic Triatoma sanguisuga (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Presence in Southeastern Louisiana,"Although rare, there have been isolated reports of autochthonous transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas in the United States. In June 2006, a human case of domestically transmitted T. cruzi was identified in southern Louisiana. To examine the localized risk of human T. cruzi infection in the area surrounding the initial human case, environmental surveys of households in the area and a serological survey of the residents were performed between September 2008 and November 2009. Human T. cruzi infection was determined using a rapid antigen field test, followed by confirmatory enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing in the laboratory. A perimeter search of each participating residence for Triatoma sanguisuga (LeConte), the predominant local triatomine species, was also performed. No participating individuals were positive for antibodies against T. cruzi; however, high levels of T. cruzi infection (62.4%) were detected in collected T. sanguisuga. Households with T. sanguisuga presence were less likely to use air conditioning, and more likely to have either chickens or cats on the property. While the human risk for T. cruzi infection in southeastern Louisiana is low, a high prevalence of infected T. sanguisuga does indicate a substantial latent risk for T. cruzi peridomestic transmission. Further examination of the behavior and ecology of T. sanguisuga in the region will assist in refining local T. cruzi risk associations."
Environmental impact on the distribution of leishmaniasis in the focus of Tizi-Ouzou (Algeria),"For many years, the highest number of visceral leishmaniasis cases registered in Algeria occur in the region of Tizi ouzou located in the northern part of the country (Kabylia). Canine leishmaniasis is also expanding in this region characterized by a diversity of landscapes along which there are many favorable biotopes for the development of a phlebotomous fauna. For our study, we divided the region into four geographical entities according to a north-south gradient, taking into account variations in the density of leishmaniasis vectors, seroprevalence of canine leishmaniasis and the number of cases of human leishmaniasis recorded in ten years. The aim of this work is to establish, in this part of the country (Kabylia), a possible correlation between the different stages of the Leishmanian life cycle. In this study, 8750 phlebotomine sandflies were captured using sticky papers and light traps. Phlebotomus perniciosus, the main vector in North Africa of Leishmania infantum, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis and P perfiliewi, the main vector of another enzymatic variant of L. infantum, a sporadic cutaneous leishmaniasis agent, were the most representative captured species with respective rates of 51.4% and 28.6% of all identified sandflies. The cumulative density of these two vector species is 104.4 sandflies per square meter in Draa El Mizan valley (Southwest of our study area), whereas it is only 2.81 individuals per square meter at the northernmost investigated area (coastline). Molecular detection of the parasite Leishmania infantum performed on 191 tested sandflies females was positive on 52 and 9 individuals of P. perniciosus and P perfiliewi respectively. The infected females all come from the area of Boghni, located in Draa El Mizan valley. In addition, serological screening of canine leishmaniasis by indirect immunofluorescence assay on 603 dogs from different ecological zones revealed an overall seroprevalence of 9.95%. Draa El Mizan is the most affected area with a rate of 16.3% of positive sera. Erom 2005 to 2010, the number of recorded cases of human leishmaniasis (VL and CL) in the region of Tizi Ouzou reached 130 cases, with 80 cases for the only Draa El Mizan area. A measured correlation coefficient revealed a significant relationship between the density of Phlebotomes of the subgenus Larroussius and the seroprevalence of canine leishmaniasis as well as the reported human leishmaniasis cases in the region."
Molecular detection of vector-borne pathogens in blood and splenic samples from dogs with splenic disease,"Background: The spleen is a highly perfused organ involved in the immunological control and elimination of vector-borne pathogens (VBP), which could have a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of splenic disease. This study aimed to evaluate certain VBP in samples from dogs with splenic lesions. Methods: Seventy-seven EDTA-blood and 64 splenic tissue samples were collected from 78 dogs with splenic disease in a Mediterranean area. Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp., Hepatozoon canis, Leishmania infantum, hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. were targeted using PCR assays. Sixty EDTA-blood samples from dogs without evidence of splenic lesions were included as a control group. Results: More than half (51.56%) of the biopsies (33/64) were consistent with benign lesions and 48.43% (31/64) with malignancy, mostly hemangiosarcoma (25/31). PCR yielded positive results in 13 dogs with spleen alterations (16.67%), for Babesia canis (n = 3), Babesia gibsoni (n = 2), hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (n = 2), Rickettsia massiliae (n = 1) and ""Babesia vulpes"" (n = 1), in blood; and for B. canis, B. gibsoni, Ehrlichia canis and L. infantum (n = 1 each), in spleen. Two control dogs (3.3%) were positive for B. gibsoni and H. canis (n = 1 each). Benign lesions were detected in the 61.54% of infected dogs (8/13); the remaining 38.46% were diagnosed with malignancies (5/13). Infection was significantly associated to the presence of splenic disease (P = 0.013). There was no difference in the prevalence of infection between dogs with benign and malignant splenic lesions (P = 0.69); however B. canis was more prevalent in dogs with hemangiosarcoma (P = 0.006). Conclusions: VBP infection could be involved in the pathogenesis of splenic disease. The immunological role of the spleen could predispose to alterations of this organ in infected dogs. Interestingly, all dogs with B. canis infection were diagnosed with hemangiosarcoma in the present survey. As previously reported, results support that VBP diagnosis could be improved by analysis of samples from different tissues. The sample size included here warrants further investigation."
"Leishmania infantum DNA detected in phlebotomine species from Puerto Iguazu City, Misiones province, Argentina","In Puerto Iguazu City, Argentina, human and canine Visceral Leishmaniasis cases have been recorded since the year 2010, with Leishmania infantum as the etiological agent and Lutzomyia longipalpis as its main vector. In the present study, polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were used to detect L. infantum DNA in 3.9% of the female sandflies captured in Puerto Iguazu City. This is the first report of L. infantum DNA detection in Micropygomyia quinquefer, and the second one in Lu. longipalpis and Nyssomyia whitmani for Argentina. Although the detection of Leishmania DNA itself is not enough to determine a Phlebotomine species as a vector, these results are significant in setting the direction of further investigations of vectorial competence and capacity, necessary to define the roles of different sandflies species as specific or permissive vectors in the transmission VL cycle."
Prevalence and Geographic Distribution of Vector-Borne Pathogens in Apparently Healthy Dogs in Croatia,"Vector-borne pathogens (VBPs) are a group of globally extended and quickly spreading pathogens that are transmitted by various arthropod vectors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the seroprevalence against Babesia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis, and Ehrlichia canis in dogs in Croatia. We investigated 435 randomly selected apparently healthy dogs in 13 different locations of Croatia for antibodies to B. canis by indirect immunofluorescence using a commercial IFA IgG Antibody Kit. All samples were also tested for qualitative detection of D. immitis antigen and for antibodies to A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi sensu lato, L. infantum, and E. canis with two point-of-care assays. Overall, 112 dogs (25.74%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 21.70-30.12) were serologically positive for one or more of the pathogens. B. canis was the most prevalent pathogen (20.00%, 95% CI 16.34-24.07), followed by A. phagocytophilum (6.21%, 95% CI 4.12-8.90), L. infantum, (1.38%, 95% CI 0.51-2.97), and B. burgdorferi sensu lato (0.69%, 95% CI 0.01-2.00). The lowest seroprevalence was for D. immitis and E. canis (0.46%, 95% CI 0.01-1.65). Coinfection was determined in 12 dogs (2.76%, 95% CI 1.43-4.77), of which 10 were positive to two pathogens (7 with B. canis and A. phagocytophilum and 1 B. canis with B. burgdorferi sensu lato or L. infantum or E. canis). One dog was positive to three pathogens and another dog to four pathogens. Seroprevalence for babesia was age, breed, and lifestyle/use dependent. Purebred dogs had almost half the chance of developing disease than crossbred (OR = 0.58, p < 0.026, 95% CI 0.37-0.94). Seropositivity to B. canis was 3.41 times higher for dogs that lived outdoors/shelter (p < 0.006) or 4.57 times higher in mixed/hunting (p < 0.001) compared to indoor/companion dogs. This is the first comprehensive survey of VBP seropositivity conducted in Croatia. Some of these VBPs are zoonotic and represent a potential risk to public health."
Factors influencing the prevalence of trypanosome infection of Glossina pallidipes on the Ruvu flood plain of Eastern Tanzania,"We report the pattern of infection of Glossina pallidipes with Trypanosoma vivax and T. congolense at a site in the Coast region of eastern Tanzania, studied between November 1993 and December 1994. Of the 2315 flies dissected 114 (4.9%) were T. congolense positive, 77 (3.3%) were T. vivax positive and 2 (0.1%) were T. brucei positive. Fly age was determined by the pteridine fluorescence method. Prevalence of infection was most strongly affected by month and the linear effect of age with the interaction of month and age having an effect for T. congolense-type infections. Sex and sex by month also have some predictive capacity when data for T. congolense and T. vivax-type infections are combined. In contrast to other similar studies our results suggest that the infection rate is non-linearly related to age of the tsetse fly, with older flies having progressively more chance of infection. The potential biological factors underpinning these interactions are discussed. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
African animal trypanosomiasis as a constraint to livestock health and production in Karamoja region: a detailed qualitative and quantitative assessment,"Background: Nagana (African Animal Trypanosomiasis-AAT) and tick-borne diseases (TBDs) constrain livestock production in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa. To this realisation, Uganda government set up an African trypanosomiasis (AT) control unit, which among other activities generates national tsetse control priority maps using apparent tsetse density data. Such maps underestimate mechanically transmitted AAT and thus ought to be refined using actual AT prevalence data. We therefore set out to generate up-to-date cattle and donkey trypanosomiasis prevalence data as well as find out the constraints to livestock production in Karamoja region in a bid to re-define AT control priority in this region. Results: Livestock keepers and animal health workers indicated that TBDs and AAT were the most important livestock diseases in Karamoja region. The prevalence of Trypanosoma spp. in cattle and donkeys was 16.3% (95% CI: 12.4-21.1%) and 32.4% (95% CI; 20.2-47.6%) respectively. Trypanosoma vivax (12.1%) and Trypanosoma congolense savannah (29.6%) were the most prevalent Trypanosoma spp. in cattle and donkeys respectively. Majority of the cattle (85.7%) and more than half of the donkey (57.1%) herds were positive for Trypanosoma spp. Conclusions: African animal trypanosomiasis and TBDs are the most important constraints to livestock production in Karamoja region. In order to improve livestock production and hence Karamajong livelihoods, government of Uganda and her development partners will need to invest in livestock health programs particularly targeting tsetse and TBD control."
"Prevalence and spatial distribution of Theileria parva in cattle under crop-livestock farming systems in Tororo District, Eastern Uganda","Background: Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) present a major economic burden to communities across East Africa. Farmers in East Africa must use acaracides to target ticks and prevent transmission of tick-borne diseases such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, cowdriosis and theileriosis; the major causes of cattle mortality and morbidity. The costs of controlling East Coast Fever (ECF), caused by Theileria parva, in Uganda are significant and measures taken to control ticks, to be cost-effective, should take into account the burden of disease. The aim of the present work was to estimate the burden presented by T. parva and its spatial distribution in a crop-livestock production system in Eastern Uganda. Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of T. parva in Tororo District, Uganda. Blood samples were taken from all cattle (n: 2,658) in 22 randomly selected villages across Tororo District from September to December 2011. Samples were analysed by PCR and T. parva prevalence and spatial distribution determined. Results: The overall prevalence of T. parva was found to be 5.3%. Herd level prevalence ranged from 0% to 21% with majority of the infections located in the North, North-Eastern and South-Eastern parts of Tororo District. No statistically significant differences in risk of infection were found between age classes, sex and cattle breed. Conclusions: T. parva infection is widely distributed in Tororo District, Uganda. The prevalence and distribution of T. parva is most likely determined by spatial distribution of R. appendiculatus, restricted grazing of calves and preferential tick control targeting draft animals."
"The burden and spatial distribution of bovine African trypanosomes in small holder crop-livestock production systems in Tororo District, south-eastern Uganda","Background: African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) is considered to be one of the greatest constraints to livestock production and livestock-crop integration in most African countries. South-eastern Uganda has suffered for more than two decades from outbreaks of zoonotic Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), adding to the burden faced by communities from AAT. There is insufficient AAT and HAT data available (in the animal reservoir) to guide and prioritize AAT control programs that has been generated using contemporary, sensitive and specific molecular techniques. This study was undertaken to evaluate the burden that AAT presents to the small-scale cattle production systems in south-eastern Uganda. Methods: Randomised cluster sampling was used to select 14% (57/ 401) of all cattle containing villages across Tororo District. Blood samples were taken from all cattle in the selected villages between September-December 2011; preserved on FTA cards and analysed for different trypanosomes using a suite of molecular techniques. Generalized estimating equation and Rogen-Gladen estimator models were used to calculate apparent and true prevalences of different trypanosomes while intra cluster correlations were estimated using a 1-way mixed effect analysis of variance (ANOVA) in R statistical software version 3.0.2. Results: The prevalence of all trypanosome species in cattle was 15.3% (95% CI; 12.2-19.1) while herd level trypanosome species prevalence varied greatly between 0-43%. Trypanosoma vivax (17.4%, 95% CI; 10.6-16.8) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (0.03%) were respectively, the most, and least prevalent trypanosome species identified. Conclusions: The prevalence of bovine trypanosomes in this study indicates that AAT remains a significant constraint to livestock health and livestock production. There is need to implement tsetse and trypanosomiasis control efforts across Tororo District by employing effective, cheap and sustainable tsetse and trypanosomiasis control methods that could be integrated in the control of other endemic vector borne diseases like tick-borne diseases."
Detection of antibodies to Leishmania donovani in animals in a kala-azar endemic region in eastern Sudan: a preliminary report,"The prevalence of antibodies against Leishmania donovani in selected domestic and wild animal species in 2 villages in Sudan with active L. donovani transmission in humans was investigated. Screening of domestic animals (donkeys, cows, sheep, goats, camels and dogs) with the direct agglutination test (DAT) detected reaction rates above the cut-off titres in donkeys (68.7%), cows (21.4%) and gears (8.5%), and which were also found in wild rats (5.5%). Sera of sheep, camels and dogs had a weak agglutination reaction below the cut-off titre. Testing of the same sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), against a lysate of L. donovani promastigotes, showed reaction rates above the cut-off optical density in cows (47.6%), goats (13.6%), and in rats (4.1%). No Leishmania parasite was isolated from spleen, liver, bone-marrow or spleen of Nile rats."
Lineage-specific rapid diagnostic tests can resolve Trypanosoma cruzi TcII/V/VI ecological and epidemiological associations in the Argentine Chaco,"Background Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan agent of Chagas disease, is comprised of at least 6 genetic lineages (TcI-TcVI). Their geographical distribution, clinical associations and reservoir hosts are not fully elucidated, as genotyping is hampered due to the difficulty in isolating representative populations of organisms. Lineage-specific serological techniques may address these issues. Methods Trypanosoma cruzi lineage-specific serological assays were performed on human, canine, feline and armadillo sera from the Gran Chaco in northern Argentina, a region of ongoing transmission. Synthetic peptides representing lineage-specific epitopes of the trypomastigote small surface antigen (TSSA) were used in ELISA, and the TcII/V/VI shared epitope peptide (TSSApep-II/V/VI) was used in the Chagas Sero K-SeT rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Results Chagas Sero K-SeT RDT, using Protein G to detect human and canine IgG, was at least as sensitive as TSSApep-II/V/VI ELISA using specific secondary antibodies. For sera from humans TSSApep-II/V/VI seroprevalence by Chagas Sero K-SeT was 273/393 (69.5%), for dogs 48/73 (65.8%) and for armadillos 1/7 (14.3%); by ELISA for cats 5/19 (26.3%). The seroprevalence for humans was similar to that for Bolivian patients, amongst whom we previously observed an association of TSSApep-II/V/VI seropositivity with severity of cardiomyopathy. In humans, prevalence of TSSApep-II/V/VI recognition was associated with locality, and with increasing and decreasing age within the Qom and Creole populations, respectively. For dogs TSSApep-II/V/VI recognition was associated with being born before community-wide insecticide spraying (P = 0.05) and with Qom household (P < 0.001). Conclusions We show here that Chagas Sero K-SeT RDT can replace ELISA for TSSApep-II/V/VI serology of humans and dogs; for humans there were statistically significant associations between a positive Chagas Sero K-SeT RDT and being resident in Area IV, and for dogs association with Qom household or with being born before the mass spraying campaign; we also show that with cats the TcII/V/VI epitope can be detected by ELISA. We assessed the lineage distribution in an unprecedented 83% of the human T. cruzi-seropositive population. These results form the basis for more detailed studies, enabling rapid in-the-field surveillance of the distribution and clustering of these lineages among humans and mammalian reservoirs of T. cruzi infection."
Pathogen prevalence in commercially reared bumble bees and evidence of spillover in conspecific populations,"Worldwide, wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are experiencing marked declines, with potentially up to 11% of species currently under threat. Recent studies from North America suggest that disease transmission from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations has led to marked range contractions in some species. In Europe, data on the prevalence of pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is lacking, despite the widespread production and transport of hives within the EU since the early 1980s. We determined the permeability of cropping systems to commercial bumble bees, and quantified the prevalence of four pathogens in commercial Bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in Ireland. Commercial bumble bees collected from 31% to 97% of non-crop pollen, depending on the cropping system, and hives had markedly higher frequencies of two gut parasites, Crithidia spp. and Nosema bombi, compared to adjacent populations, but were free of tracheal mites. The highest prevalence of Crithida was observed within 2 km of greenhouses and the probability of infection declined in a host sex- and pathogen-specific manner up to 10 km. We suggest implementing measures that prevent the interaction of commercially reared and wild bumble bees by integrating the enforcement of national best management practices for users of commercial pollinators with international legislation that regulates the sanitation of commercial hives in production facilities.

The study of trypanosome species circulating in domestic animals in two human African trypanosomiasis foci of C√¥te d'Ivoire identifies pigs and cattle as potential reservoirs of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense,
Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Technique based Prevalence of Surra in Equines,This project was carried out to find the prevalence of trypanosomiasis in equine in District Gujranwala by using indirect fluorescent antibody technique and thin smear method. Blood samples were collected from a total of 200 horses and donkeys of different ages and either sex. Duplicate thin blood smears were prepared from each sample and remaining blood samples were centrifuged to separate the serum. Smears from each animal were processed for giemsa staining and indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Giemsa stained smears revealed Trypanosome infection in 4/200 (2.0%) samples and IFAT in 12/200 (6.0%) animals. (C) 2011 PVJ. All rights reserved
"Haemoprotozoa of cattle in Northern Kerala, India","A cross-sectional study was conducted using 150 blood samples collected from apparently normal / healthy crossbred cattle of Northern Kerala, South India, for detection of haemoprotozoan infections using staining techniques (Giemsa and Acridine Orange) and specific PCR. Theileria like piroplasms and Babesia bigemina were the only protozoan organisms detected in blood smears. Polymerase chain reaction using specific primers revealed amplification of products specific for Trypanosoma evansi (34.6%), Theileria sp. other than T annulata (16%) and B. bigemina (0.6%). The higher prevalence rate of Trypanosoma evansi indicated that the subclinical parasitism can be due to higher prevalence of tabanid flies. The study also revealed the presence of a theilerial piroplasm other than T. annulata in North Kerala, which needs further investigation."
Molecular epidemiological studies on animal trypanosomiases in Ghana,"Background: African trypanosomes are extracellular protozoan parasites that are transmitted between mammalian hosts by the bite of an infected tsetse fly. Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense or T. brucei gambiense, while African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is caused mainly by T. vivax, T. congolense, T. simiae, T. evansi and T. brucei brucei. Trypanosomiasis is of public health importance in humans and is also the major constraint for livestock productivity in sub-Saharan African countries. Scanty information exists about the trypanosomiasis status in Ghana especially regarding molecular epidemiology. Therefore, this study intended to apply molecular tools to identify and characterize trypanosomes in Ghana. Methods: A total of 219 tsetse flies, 248 pigs and 146 cattle blood samples were collected from Adidome and Koforidua regions in Ghana in 2010. Initial PCR assays were conducted using the internal transcribed spacer one (ITS1) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) primers, which can detect most of the pathogenic trypanosome species and T. vivax-specific cathepsin L-like gene primers. In addition, species-or subgroup-specific PCRs were performed for T. b. rhodesiense, T. b. gambiense, T. evansi and three subgroups of T. congolense. Results: The overall prevalence of trypanosomes were 17.4% (38/219), 57.5% (84/146) and 28.6% (71/248) in tsetse flies, cattle and pigs, respectively. T. congolense subgroup-specific PCR revealed that T. congolense Savannah (52.6%) and T. congolense Forest (66.0%) were the endemic subgroups in Ghana with 18.6% being mixed infections. T. evansi was detected in a single tsetse fly. Human infective trypanosomes were not detected in the tested samples. Conclusion: Our results showed that there is a high prevalence of parasites in both tsetse flies and livestock in the study areas in Ghana. This enhances the need to strengthen control policies and institute measures that help prevent the spread of the parasites."
"Serological and Molecular Findings of Leishmania Infection in Healthy Donkeys (Equus asinus) from a Canine Leishmaniosis Endemic Focus in Tuscany, Italy: A Preliminary Report","Leishmania parasites are considered to be emergent zoonotic pathogens, which is a new concept regarding their epidemiology and the identification of novel animal hosts. The present study is the first in Italy to evaluate anti Leishmania seroprevalence, and the first in Europe to detect parasite DNA in donkeys' blood. The study was performed on jennies living in a Leishmania infantum endemic area of Central Italy. One hundred and ten blood samples were obtained from 67 healthy lactating Amiatina jennies that were semi-extensively reared in Tuscany. When possible, more than one sample was subsequently obtained from the same subject. All samples were processed by immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For the results, 11 out of 30 animals (36.7%) showed positive scores under IFAT. In addition, 22 out of the other 37 jennies had positive scores, also. The animals showed titers ranging from 40 to 320. Furthermore, 2 subjects that were submitted for 2 and 3 blood samplings, both had more than one positive score. Moreover, 2 seropositive animals were positive for Leishmania DNA. Donkeys are considered to be a preferred source for a sandfly blood meal, even if clinical leishmaniosis has never been reported in Europe for this animal species. In the view of these facts, our preliminary findings would suggest the role of donkey as a potential reservoir for this protozoan agent. Additional studies would be welcome to elucidate the role of the donkey in Leishmania epidemiology of CanL endemic areas and to confirm the preliminary findings and the hypothesis proposed here."
Detection of Leishmania infantum by cytocentrifugation in peripheral blood from Leishmania positive PCR dogs,"The veterinary guidelines for blood transfusion suggest Leishmania infantum screening by PCR techniques among potential blood donors for evaluating the infection risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether circulating amastigotes in peripheral blood may be detected using a cytocentrifugation technique in dogs with Leishmania infection confirmed by blood nested-PCR. For that, 20 untreated positive blood n-PCR dogs with serum anti-Leishmania antibodies (evidenced by IFAT) were included in this study, clinically examined and some conventional haematological and biochemical parameters were also determined leading to classify dogs into symptomatic (at least 3 anomalies, n = 6), oligosymptomatic (1 to 3 anomalies, n = 9) and asymptomatic (no detected anomaly, n = 5) groups. Prevalence of amastigotes determined by cytocentrifugation, mainly located into neutrophils, was 50% and 1 to 3 parasites by cytospot were evidenced in 3 symptomatic, 4 oligosymptomatic and in 3 asymptomatic dogs. In conclusion, blood n-PCR positive dogs reasonably harbour Leishmania organisms in peripheral blood and because asymptomatic n-PCR positive dogs have circulating amastigotes, the present study supports the recommendation to test and exclude n-PCR positive animals from blood donor programs."
Prevalence of canine vector-borne pathogens in imported and travelling dogs in Germany and studies on the prevention of CVBD,"With rising numbers of dogs taken abroad or being imported, arthropod-borne diseases in dogs (canine vector-borne diseases - CVBD) have increased in frequency in German veterinary practices. First autochthonous cases point to the growing probability that some CVBD, formerly reckoned as exotic, are on their way to become endemic in Germany. Knowledge of the prevalence of the pathogens in the countries of origin and of possible means of prophylaxis is necessary to prevent further spread, especially concerning zoonotic CVBD. In this study, 4,681 dogs without clinical symptoms that had either been travelled to or imported from endemic areas were examined. The samples were sent in within 2004-2009 from animal welfare organisations or private persons via veterinary offices. Most of the dogs were imported from Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Romania and Italy. Overall, Babesia cards (24 %) was detected as the most prevalent pathogen, followed by Anaplasma spp. (18 %), Leishmania infantum (12 %) and Ehrlichia canis (10 %). In 56 % of these dogs no antibodies or pathogens were found. In 29 %, one pathogen could be detected, and 15 % of the dogs had infections with 2-5 pathogens. Additionally, 331 dogs designed for relocation to Germany were tested in endemic areas in Portugal. Only 13 % of these were negative for all pathogens tested. 24 % were positive for one of the pathogens, and 63 % showed multiple infections with 2-6 pathogens. In the Portuguese dogs, only L. infantum and microfilariae had a comparatively lower prevalence. The other pathogens were detected even more frequently (B. coins: 58 %, E. canis: 25 %, Anaplasma spp.: 30 %, Rickettsia spp.: 63 %). In addition to the study on prevalences of CVBDs results of an examination of the preventive effect of Imidacloprid 10 %/Permethrin 50 % (dermal spot-on) are presented."
Leishmania infantum in wild rodents: reservoirs or just irrelevant incidental hosts?,"Wild rodents constitute a very large biomass of potential reservoirs for Leishmania spp. Therefore, an epidemiological study was carried out in a well-known focus of canine leishmaniasis from southern Spain, with the objective of detecting and characterizing Leishmania infantum infection in wild rodents. Blood, liver, spleen, bone marrow, and skin from 37 rodents (24 Apodemus sylvaticus, 9 Rattus rattus, and 4 Mus musculus) were analyzed by optical microscopy, culture, and two different polymerase chain reactions. L. infantum DNA was found in 27 % (10 out of 37) of the trapped rodents, in a variety of tissues: bone marrow, spleen, or healthy skin (ear lobe). High prevalences of L. infantum infection were found in the three investigated rodent species. The presence of other trypanosomatids was also evidenced. These rodent species are abundant, widely distributed in Europe, and have a long enough lifespan to overcome the low sandfly activity season. They live in a suitable habitat for sandflies and serve as blood sources for these insects, which can become infected when induced to feed on Leishmania-infected animals. Whether they are reservoirs or just irrelevant incidental hosts, it is clear that the epidemiology of L. infantum is more complex than previously thought, and so is its control. The classic epidemiological cycle dog-sandfly-human is turning into a network of animal species that collaborate with the dog in the maintenance of the parasite under natural conditions and probably showing local differences."
"The Trypanosoma evansi infection of camel in Chad: epidemiological factors and effects on some blood components, protein and energy constituents","The latex agglutination antigen test (Suratex) in conjunction with parasitological examination of blood smears were used to study the epidemiolgy of camel trypanosomiasis in Chad. The results showed an overall infection rates of approximately 6.01% and 24.68% for the parasitological examination and serological technique, respectively. The survey indicated that the infection rate varied according to the geographical region and management practices. While the infection rates was 0% for Zouar (Region I) and Faya-Tigui-Couba (Region II) using parasitological examination, the serological test indicated a prevalence of 6% and 10%, respectively. The infection rates for Kalait-Oumchalouba-Fada (Region III) were 12.08% with the detection by parasitological technique and 38.34% by Suratex. Using parasitological examination, Biltine (Region IV) and Kanem (Region V) revealed prevalences of 12.29% and 8.23% however, the serological test gave 40.98% and 31.37%, respectively. The infection rates were significantly higher (P < 0.001) among nomadic camel herds compared to that of sedentary ones. The prevalence was low (P < 0.001) among young camels, reached the maximum at 5 to 10 years old and tended to decrease from 10 years old. The survey indicated that the surra infection had a significant negative effect in the blood components and protein constituents of camels impending their productivity."
Canine leishmaniasis due to Leishmania infantum MON-1 in northern Morocco,"A seroprevalence study of canine leishmaniasis was carried out in five provinces in northern Morocco: Taounate, Al Hoceima, Zouagha Moulay Yacoub, Chefchaouen and Ouezzane. 55 localities have been concerned and a total of 1,013 dogs were screened, which represents almost 100% of the canine census. Of the screened dogs: 87 showed antibody titer greater than or equal to 100 when tested by IFAT (seroprevalence of 8.6 %) and were distributed in 83 asymptomatics (without clinical symptoms) and four symptomatics (with one or several symptoms of leishmaniasis) with important variations according to the locality. Relative frequency of asymptomatic dogs wets observed (8.2 %), and the seroprevalence increased in middle altitude (500 m < altitude < 1,000 m) and high altitude (greater than or equal to 1,000 m). Parasites isolated from dogs were identified as L. infantum MON-1 by isoenzyme profile and Rsal digestion."
"EPIZOOTIOLOGY OF TRYPANOSOMIASIS IN LAMBWE VALLEY, KENYA, EAST-AFRICA","The probability of a Glossina pallidipes picking up an infection from a single blood meal in Lambwe Valley was estimated to be 0.0092 for Trypanosoma vivax, 0.0028 for T. congolense, 0.00097 for T. brucei and 0.00024 for the human infective T. brucei. In cattle, the prevalence of blood protozoa was Trypanosoma spp. 5.55%, Babesia spp. 2% and Theileria spp. 33.06%. Thirty-eight point three per cent of the cattle with trypanosomes also had Theileria spp., 2.12% of the cattle with trypanosomes also had Babesia spp. and 88.28% of the cattle with babesia had also Theileria spp."
Animal-level risk factors for Trypanosoma evansi infection in camels in eastern and central parts of Kenya,"NGAIRA, J.M., BETT, B. & KARANJA, S.M. 2002. Animal-level risk factors for Trypanosoma evansi infection in camels in eastern and central parts of Kenya. Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research, 69:263-271. Point prevalences and animal-level risk factors for Trypanosoma evansi infection were investigated in a cross-sectional study that involved 2 227 camels from eastern and central parts of Kenya. The screening tests used were haematocrit centrifugation technique (HCT), mouse inoculation and latex agglutination (Suratex(R))). All camels were screened with HCT, while 396 and 961 of them were, in addition, screened with mouse inoculation and Suratex(R) tests, respectively. Parasitological and Suratex(R) test results were used in parallel to determine the number of camels exposed to T. evansi infections. Statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Analysis Systems. Parasitological and Suratex(R) test results in parallel were dependent variables in multivariable logistic regression models that determined risk factors for T. evansi infection. Herd-level clustering was corrected with general estimation equations. The prevalences were 2.3 % and 19.6 %, using parasitological and Suratex(R) tests, respectively, and 21.7 % when both tests were used in parallel. There was a positive association between the screening tests (McNemar's test = 104.8, P = 0.001) although the strength of association was low (Kappa = 0.2; 95 % Cl: 0.1- 0.3). Before accounting for herd-level clustering, dry season (OR = 1.5; 95 % Cl: 1.0, 2.1) and nomadic pastoralism (OR = 1.8; 95 % Cl: 1. 1, 3.2) were associated with increased odds of a camel being exposed to T evansi infection compared to wet season and ranching, respectively. Following this correction, only nomadic pastoralism was significantly associated (OR = 3.1; 95 % Cl = 1.0, 14.4) with T. evansi infection compared to ranching. It is concluded that camels managed under nomadic pastoralism had higher risk of being exposed to T. evansi infections than camels from ranching systems of management."
Evaluation of antigen and antibody rapid detection tests for Trypanosoma evansi infection in camels in Kenya,"The card agglutination test for Trypanosoma evansi (CATT/T evansi) for the detection of antibodies, and Suratex((R)) for the detection of circulating antigens were compared in a cross-sectional study involving camels in eastern and central parts of Kenya. Of the 2227 camels screened, 2038 were owned by nomadic pastoralists in T evansi endemic areas in eastern Kenya. A herd of 86 camels were from a ranch in Mugwoni. In Athi River area, 35 camels belonged to Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research Institute, and 68 were slaughter animals. Diagnostic sensitivity estimates were obtained by testing sera from 51 camels that had been found to be parasitologically positive by the haematocrit centrifugation technique, buffy-coat technique and mouse inoculation. Diagnostic specificity was estimated by testing sera from 35 camels known to be trypanosome-free. Positive and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated using a range of prevalence values. The sensitivity of CATT/T evansi (68.6%) was higher than that of Suratex((R)) (58.8%), but not significantly. Both tests had equally high specificity (100%). The overall prevalence was 2.3% (51 out of 2227) by parasite detection, 32.2% (327 out of 1017) by CATT/T evansi and 19.6% (188 out of 961) by Suratex((R)). Overall, there was a positive association between CATT/T evansi and Suratex((R)) though the strength of association was low (McNemar's test = 46.12, P = 0.001; kappa = 0.26, CI: 0.20-0.33). Parasite prevalence ranged from 0% in several herds to 27.8% in a herd in Isiolo. Prevalence was highest in Isiolo with 2.5% (51 out of 2030) by parasitological detection, 38.8% (321 out of 828) by CATT/T evansi and 21.9% (169 out of 772) by Suratex((R)). In Mugwoni prevalence was 7 and 18% by CATT/T evansi and Suratex((R)), respectively, and no parasites were detected. In Athi River Suratex((R)) detected 2.9% (3 out of 103) positive while CATT/T evansi and parasitological methods gave negative results. At prevalence values between 10 and 100%, CATT/T evansi as well as Suratex((R)) had infinitely high positive predictive values, whereas Suratex((R)) had a lower NPV than CATT/T evansi. In conclusion, results of this study showed that CATT/T evansi and Suratex((R)) were able to detect aparasitaemic infections rapidly and were more sensitive than parasitological methods in revealing the true extent of trypanosomosis in a herd. The tests effectively complemented parasitological methods in the detection of T evansi infections in camels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
Molecular screening of tsetse flies and cattle reveal different Trypanosoma species including T. grayi and T. theileri in northern Cameroon,"Background: African trypanosomes are mainly transmitted through the bite of tsetse flies (Glossina spp.). The present study investigated the occurrence of pathogenic trypanosomes in tsetse flies and cattle in tsetse fly-infested areas of Northern Cameroon. Results: Trypanosomes were identified using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region, both by size estimation and sequencing of PCR products. Apparent density indices recorded in Gamba and Dodeo were 3.1 and 3.6 tsetse flies per trap and day, respectively. Trypanosoma prevalence infection rate for the tsetse fly gut (40%) and proboscis (19%) were recorded. Among the flies where trypanosomes were detected in the gut, 41.7% were positive for T. congolense and 14.6% for T. brucei ssp., whereas in the proboscis 36% harboured T. congolense and 62% contained T. vivax. T. grayi was highly prevalent in tsetse fly gut (58%). The most common mixed infections were the combination of T. congolense and T. grayi. Trypanosome prevalence rate in cattle blood was 6%. Among these, T. vivax represented 26%, T. congolense 35%, T. brucei ssp. 17% and T. theileri 17% of the infections. Surprisingly, in one case T. grayi was found in cattle. The mean packed cell volume (PCV) of cattle positive for trypanosomes was significantly lower (24.1 +/- 5.6%; P < 0.05) than that of cattle in which trypanosomes were not detected (27.1 +/- 4.9%). Interestingly, the occurrence of T. theileri or T. grayi DNA in cattle also correlated with low PCV at pathological levels. Conclusion: This molecular epidemiological study of Trypanosoma species in Northern Cameroon revealed active foci of trypanosomes in Dodeo and Gamba. These findings are relevant in assessing the status of trypanosomosis in these regions and will serve as a guide for setting the priorities of the government in the control of the disease."
Patterns of tsetse abundance and trypanosome infection rates among habitats of surveyed villages in Maasai steppe of northern Tanzania,"Background: Changes of land cover modify the characteristics of habitat, host-vector interaction and consequently infection rates of disease causing agents. In this paper, we report variations in tsetse distribution patterns, abundance and infection rates in relation to habitat types and age in the Maasai Steppe of northern Tanzania. In Africa, Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis negatively impacted human life where about 40 million people are at risk of contracting the disease with dramatic socio-economical consequences, for instance, loss of livestock, animal productivity, and manpower. Methods: We trapped tsetse flies in dry and wet seasons between October 2014 and May 2015 in selected habitats across four villages: Emboreet, Loiborsireet, Kimotorok and Oltukai adjacent to protected areas. Data collected include number and species of tsetse flies caught in baited traps, PCR identification of trypanosome species and extraction of monitored Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Results: Our findings demonstrate the variation of tsetse fly species abundance and infection rates among habitats in surveyed villages in relation to NDVI and host abundance. Results have shown higher tsetse fly abundance in Acacia-swampy ecotone and riverine habitats for Emboreet and other villages, respectively. Tsetse abundance was inconsistent among habitats in different villages. Emboreet was highly infested with Glossina swynnertoni (68%) in ecotone and swampy habitats followed by G. morsitans (28%) and G. pallidipes (4%) in riverine habitat. In the remaining villages, the dominant tsetse fly species by 95% was G. pallidipes in all habitats. Trypanosoma vivax was the most prevalent species in all infected flies (95%) with few observations of co-infections (with T. congolense or T. brucei). Conclusions: The findings of this study provide a framework to mapping hotspots of tsetse infestation and trypanosomiasis infection and enhance the communities to plan for effective control of trypanosomiasis."
"Variations of Glossina sp. and trypanosome species frequency within different habitats in a sleeping sickness focus, Gabon","Introduction: Knowledge of the infectious status of the Glossina is an indicator of risk of resurgence of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). Environmental conditions have an impact on the density and diversity of both vector and Trypanosoma. The aim of the study was to determine the diversity and the infection rate of Glossina as well as the diversity of trypanosome species within habitats of an old HAT focus, in Gabon. Methodology: Glossina were captured in September 2012 in three ecological sites. Vavoua traps were installed for twelve days. All captured flies were identified. Glossina were selected for trypanosome identification by Polymerase Chain Reaction. Results: 1178 Glossina were captured: 55.8% in degraded forest, 28.9% in flood area and 15.4% in secondary forest. Glossina fusca congolensis (37%) and G.palpalis palpalis (36.4%) were the most abundant vector species. G. fusca congolensis was predominant in secondary forest and in flood area, while in degraded forest, it was G.palpalis palpalis. Trypanosoma infection rate was 30.7%, 42% in secondary forest, 32% in degraded forest and 18% in flood area. Trypanosoma congolense savannah was the main species detected (18.7%) followed by T. brucei brucei (10.7%) and T. brucei gambiense (4%). T. congolense savannah type was predominant in the secondary forest and in degraded forest (66.7% versus 55.5%). Conclusion: Glossina density and trypanosome infection rate varied according to the habitat within HAT focus. The density of tsetse was the highest in degraded forest while the infection rate was highest in secondary forest. Continuous disease surveillance and control measures are needed."
High Frequency of (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) Type Among (Diptera: Glossinidae) in a Historic Trypanosoma Foci in North-Eastern Gabon: Preliminary Study,"Human African trypanosomiasis became a neglected disease after the 1960s, when case numbers dropped dramatically. It again became a public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa at the end of the 1990s, when new cases were reported, notably in Central Africa, and specifically in Gabon, where historic foci existed and new cases have been reported. Therefore, the present study reports on an entomological survey conducted in May 2012 to determine the pathogenic trypanosome infection rate in tsetse flies and characterize the diversity of Trypanosoma species in the Ivindo National Park (INP) in northeastern Gabon. Nine Vavoua traps were used to catch tsetse over a 7-days period. All tsetse flies captured were identified to species, dissected, and trypanosome species identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In total, 160 tsetse flies were analyzed, including Glossina palpalis palpalis, Glossina fusca congolense, and Glossina tachinoides. The trypanosome infection rate of the flies was 6.3 and 31.9% using microscopy and PCR, respectively. The species identified were Trypanosoma congolense savannah type, Trypanosoma brucei brucei, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, Trypanosoma vivax, and Trypanosoma congolense forest type. Trypanosoma risk index was 0.75 and 7.05 for humans and for animals, respectively. This study illustrates the diversity of Trypanosoma species infecting the tsetse flies in the INP. The simultaneous occurrence of Trypanosoma and tsetse from the palpalis group may suggest that the reservoirs of African animal trypanosomiasis should be carefully monitored in this area."
Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma evansi Infection in Water Buffaloes from the Mountainous Region of North Vietnam and Effectiveness of Trypanocidal Drug Treatment,"Water buffalo (WB) is an important domestic animal in Vietnam. This study utilized a card agglutination test to investigate seroprevalence of surra in WB population. Sera were collected from 585 WB from 4 different regions in Cao Bang and Thai Nguyen Provinces. Among them, 131 samples (22.4%) were positive for surra. The highest prevalence (24.6%) was found among 3 to 5 years old WB. Buffaloes less than 3 years old had the lowest prevalence (15.6%). Among 27 abortion cases, 9 WB (33.3%) were surra positive. For treatment of surra, Berenil(R) demonstrated a 100% cure rate, while that of Trypamidium(R) was only 40%. Our findings suggest that the current control strategy has not succeeded in reducing prevalence of surra in Vietnam."
"Application of crude and recombinant ELISAs and immunochromatographic test for serodiagnosis of animal trypanosomosis in the Umkhanyakude district of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa","A total of 231 serum samples were collected from sheep (n=9), goats (n=99) and cattle (n=123) in northeastern KwaZuluNatal, South Africa. Trypanosome infection was detected using Trypanosoma brucei brucei crude antigen (TbbCA) and T congolense crude antigen (TcoCA) ELISA assays. Recombinant antigen (T evansi GM6 which consisted of 4 repeat domains, TeGM6-4r) ELISA and immunochromatographic test (ICT) were also used. Crude antigen ELISA, TeGM6-4r-ELISA and ICT detected 27.3%, 29% and 19.9% of trypanosome seropositive samples, respectively. Trypanosome infection prevalence in cattle and goats was 35.8-46.3% and 0-9.1%, respectively. Out of 9 sheep serum samples, 2-4 sera (22.2-44.4%) were positive. The detection performance of crude and recombinant antigen ELISAs was relatively similar (K=0.6-0.7); both are recommended for reference diagnosis and large scale epidemiological surveys. There is potential application for ICT in on-site diagnosis, but its sensitivity should be improved."
"Trypanosoma cruzi in a Mexican Free-Tailed Bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) in Oklahoma, USA","Trypanosoma cruzi is a vector-borne protozoan parasite that infects seven million individuals in Central and South America and is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease. There are increasing reports of endemic transmission within the southern US. Trypanosoma cruzi occurs in wild raccoons and dogs in Oklahoma, but its endemicity in the state is poorly studied. We suspected Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) contributed to the endemicity of T. cruzi in Oklahoma due to their annual migration from Central America to their North American maternity roosts. During the summer of 2017, we sampled 361 Mexican free-tailed bats for T. cruzi at three maternity roosts in Oklahoma. We collected wing tissues, extracted T. cruzi DNA, amplified target DNA by PCR using the primers TCZ1/TCZ2, and observed amplification by gel electrophoresis. One juvenile Mexican free-tailed bat was positive for T. cruzi resulting in a 0.27% prevalence in the 361 sampled bats. Our finding of a wild bat naturally infected with T. cruzi in Oklahoma provided insight on the endemicity of T. cruzi in underrepresented endemic areas. The positive sample was sequenced, confirmed as T. cruzi, and uploaded to GenBank (no. MG869732). Future research will focus on monitoring T. cruzi prevalence in wild bats and insect vectors to better understand the enzootic emergence of this neglected tropical parasite."
"TRYPANOSOMA VIVAX, T. CONGOLENSE ""FOREST TYPE"" AND T. SIMIAE: PREVALENCE IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS OF SLEEPING SICKNESS FOCI OF CAMEROON","In order to better understand the epidemiology of Human and Animal trypanosomiasis that occur together in sleeping sickness foci, a study of prevalences of animal parasites (Trypanosoma vivax, T congolense ""forest type"", and T simiae) infections was conducted on domestic animals to complete the previous work carried on T brucei gambiense prevalence using the same animal sample. 875 domestic animals, including 307 pigs, 264 goats, 267 sheep and 37 dogs were sampled in the sleeping sickness foci of Bipindi, Campo, Doume and Fontem in Cameroon. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method was used to identify these trypanosome species. A total of 237 (27.08 %) domestic animals were infected by at least one trypanosome species. The prevalence of T vivax, T congolense ""forest type"" and T simiae were 20.91 %, 11.42 % and 0.34 % respectively. The prevalences of T vivax and T. congolense ""forest type"" differed significantly between the animal species and between the foci (p < 0.0001); however, these two trypanosomes were found in all animal species as well as in all the foci subjected to the study. The high prevalences of T vivax and T. congolense ""forest type"" in Bipindi and Fontem-Center indicate their intense transmission in these foci."
DOMESTIC ANIMALS AS POTENTIAL RESERVOIR HOSTS OF TRYPANOSOMA BRUCEI GAMBIENSE IN SLEEPING SICKNESS FOCI IN CAMEROON,"An explanation of the endemic nature and/or the resurgence of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the historic foci in West end Central Africa may be the existence of an animal reservoir. In some HAT foci, pigs were found infected by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense but the implication of the other domestic animals was not quite evaluated. This study aims to determine the prevalence of T. b. gambiense in domestic animal species (goat, sheep, pig and dog) commonly found in the four active HAT foci in Cameroon (Bipindi, Fontem, Campo and Doume). Blood samples were collected from 307 pigs, 264 goats, 267 sheep and 37 dogs and used for parasitological (QBC), immunological (LiTat 1.3 CATT) and moleculcr (PCR) analyses. QBC defected trypanosomes in 3.88 % domestic animals while 22.7 % were sero-positive with LiTat 1.3 CATT tests. Of the 875 animals analysed, 174 (19 88 %) harboured T. brucei sl DNA, found in each of the four types of animal and in the four localities. The infection rate significantly differed among the animal species (p < 0.0001) and localities (p < 0.0001). The PCR also revealed T. b. gambiense group I DNA in 27 (108 %) domestic animals. The specific infection rates were as follows: sheep (6.74 %), goats (3.08 %), pigs 0.32 %) and dogs (0 %). T. b. gambiense was found in 8 (3.92 %) animals from Bipindi, 15 (4.83 %) from Campo, 4 (2,59 %) from Fontem-Center and none from Doume. The infection rates significantly differed between the localities, and correlated with the intensity of HAT transmission in the foci."
Detection of Trypanosoma evansi in camels using PCR and CATT/T. evansi tests in Kenya,"Camel trypanosomosis (Surra) causes high morbidity and is an impediment to the camel husbandry in Kenya. The lack of a sensitive diagnostic test has hindered the collection of accurate epidemiological data and institution of control programmes. A cross-sectional study was conducted in three districts of Kenya to estimate the prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi (T evansi) and to compare four diagnostic tests: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), card agglutination test (CATT/ T evansi), microhaematocrit centrifugation technique (MHCT) and mouse inoculation (MI). A total of 549 camels were randomly sampled. The overall prevalence of Surra was 5.3% using MHCT, 26.6% using PCR and 45.9% using CATT/T. evansi. There was a significant difference (P < 0.001) between PCR and CATT/T evansi test, MHCT and MI in detection of T evansi. The prevalence of T evansi was 39.8% in Samburu, 24.7% in Nanyuki and 14.4% in Isiolo districts using PCR. A male camel was 2.6 times more likely to be infected with T evansi compared to a female camel (OR = 3.0% Cl: 1.6, 4.1), while an adult camel was 2.2 times more likely to be infected compared to non-adults (OR = 2.2; 95% Cl: 1.2, 5.0). There was a poor association between the presence of the published clinical signs and seropositivity (&kappa; = 0.12), PCR (&kappa; = 0.11) and MHCT (&kappa; = 0.05). However, there was a higher agreement between farmers' classification of disease with the PCR test (&kappa; = 0.5, n = 61). The mean PCV varied with age, presence of infection, locality and gender, with the lowest mean PCV being recorded in MHCT-positive animals (20.97 +/- 0.5) and from infected calves (19.5 +/- 1.2). This study shows that PCR was more sensitive in detecting T evansi than other tests used. Further, the prevalence of T evansi in the camel herds sampled is higher than that previously reported in Kenya, and that the judgment by camel keepers may be a reliable ""pen-side"" diagnostic test for Surra. Considering the low sensitivity of parasitological techniques in detection of chronic T evansi infection and high cost of PCR, development of a sensitive pen side diagnostic test, with a low cost is still a priority.

"Seroprevalence of Neospora caninum Infection and Associated Risk Factors in Cattle of Sistan Areas, Southeastern Iran in 2016","Background: Neospora caninum is protozoan parasitic disease now described as the major cause of abortion and other reproductive issues. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of N. caninum in cattle breeds of the Sistan region, southeastern border area of Iran. Methods: Using an ELISA kit (ID. VET, France), the antibodies against N. caninum in cattle of Sistan was evaluated in 2016. Overall, 184 blood samples from apparently healthy cattle in the eastern border area of Iran Sistan were collected for assessment of antibodies against N. caninum. The values greater than or equal to 50%, were considered positive based on manufacture's manual for ELASA kit. Results: 3.8% of 184 cattle have antibody against N. caninum. Chi-square test showed that the seroprevalence among Holsteins, Sistan and cross-breed was 9.4%, 0%, and 4.3%, respectively. No significant difference was observed among the breeds (P>0.05). The seroprevalence was decreased as the age of cow increased and there is no significant difference between the prevalence of N. caninum and different city area. No statistically significant relationship between the seroprevalence of N. caninum and history of abortion, lactation number and infertility was observed. Although there was no significant difference between the cattle breeds of the Sistan region all the Sistani cows were negative for the antibody against N. caninum. Conclusion: Infection rate with N. caninum in bovine population in Sistan region is very low. Environmental and management factors are the major causes, which influence the regional prevalence."
Increased Trypanosoma spp. richness and prevalence of haemoparasite co-infection following translocation,"BackgroundUnderstanding how fauna translocation and antiparasitic drug treatment impact parasite community structure within a host is vital for optimising translocation outcomes. Trypanosoma spp. and piroplasms (Babesia and Theileria spp.) are known to infect Australian marsupials, including the woylie (Bettongia penicillata). However relatively little is known about these haemoparasites, or how they respond to management practices such as translocation. We monitored haemoparasites infecting woylies for up to 12months during two fauna translocations to supplement existing woylie populations in three different sites (Dryandra, Walcott and Warrup East) within south-western Australia between 2014 and 2016, with the aim of investigating (i) how haemoparasite prevalence, Trypanosoma spp. richness and Trypanosoma spp. community composition varied over time and between different sites following translocation; and (ii) whether ivermectin treatment indirectly impacts haemoparasite prevalence. Using molecular methods, 1211 blood samples were screened for the presence of trypanosomes, and a subset of these samples (n=264) were also tested for piroplasms.ResultsTrypanosomes and piroplasms were identified in 55% and 94% of blood samples, respectively. We identified five Trypanosoma species, two Theileria species, a single species of Babesia and a novel Bodo species. Trypanosoma spp. richness and the prevalence of haemoparasite co-infection increased after translocation. Prior to translocation, Trypanosoma spp. community composition differed significantly between translocated and resident woylies within Walcott and Warrup East, but not Dryandra. Six months later, there was a significant difference between translocated and resident woylies within Dryandra, but not Walcott or Warrup East. The response of haemoparasites to translocation was highly site-specific, with predominant changes to the haemoparasite community in translocated woylies occurring within the first few months following translocation. Ivermectin treatment had no significant effect on haemoparasite prevalence.ConclusionsThis study contributes to our understanding of haemoparasite dynamics in woylies following translocation. The highly site-specific and rapid response of haemoparasites to translocation highlights the need to better understand what drives these effects. Given that haemoparasite prevalence and composition of translocated and resident animals changed significantly following translocation, we propose that parasite monitoring should form an essential component of translocation protocols, and such protocols should endeavour to monitor translocated hosts and cohabiting species."
"Leishmania infantum INFECTION IN DOGS FROM THE SOUTHERN REGION OF MINAS GERAIS STATE, BRAZIL","Visceral leishmaniasis is a systemic and chronic disease and dogs are the main reservoir of the etiologic agent, Leishmania infantum (syn L. chagasi). A serological and molecular investigation of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) was performed in the municipality of Alfenas, located in the southern region of Minas Gerais, where the disease is not endemic. Samples from 87 dogs were submitted to serological tests including the Dual Path Platform (DPP (R)) CVL Bio-Manguinhos rapid test, an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), as well as molecular techniques such as a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the RV1/RV2 primers and a quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the LinJ31, Ldon and DNApol primers. Of the 87 serum samples, eight (9.2%) were positive for Leishmania using the DPP rapid test, but only four (4.6%) were confirmed by ELISA and two (2.3%) by IFAT. In these two serologically confirmed cases, spleen and liver samples were positive by all the employed molecular and parasitological procedures performed on spleen samples. When whole blood samples were used in the molecular assays, two samples (2.3%) were positive only by qPCR. DNA extracted and amplified from the spleens of seropositive dogs was sequenced, showing 100% of similarity with the Leishmania infantum (syn L. chagasi) sequence. Thus, the first cases of CVL have been confirmed in the Alfenas region, suggesting the importance of canine surveys in non-endemic municipalities for CVL to monitor disease progression and to prevent outbreaks."
"The prevalence of horse trypanosomiasis in Sumba Island, Indonesia and its detection using card agglutination tests","Background and Aim: Horses have a strategic and vital role to play in the lives of the people of Sumba Island, East Nusa Tenggara Province. They act as social animals that are involved in death ceremonies, horse races, and during pasola, thereby supporting tourism, and are given away as dowry in wedding ceremonies. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of trypanosomiasis among horses in four districts of Sumba Island by examining clinical symptoms and detecting parasites, antibodies, and other factors that are related to Trypanosoma evansi infection in horses. Materials and Methods: We studied a total of 211 horses that belonged to 88 clinical hobby breeders. Giemsa-colored smears and serum were examined in order to detect antibodies using card-agglutination tests (CATT). The study was conducted during the rainy season that lasted from January to March 2017. Potential risk factors such as the species, sex, origin of the livestock, how the livestock were maintained, and the farmers' knowledge concerning trypanosomiasis were recorded using questionnaires. Data were collected annually for three years from 2010-2012 and repeatedly analyzed by a Chi-square test. Results: Clinical signs of trypanosomiasis were found in 34 horses; blood smears were examined using Giemsa staining and negative preparations were obtained at a frequency of 0.0% (0/211). The CATT results generally showed that 13.3% (28/211) of the samples were seropositive for antibodies to T. evansi; the highest percentage, 16.67% (8/48), of seropositivity was found in the West Sumba District, and the lowest, 12.0% (5/50), was found in Southwest Sumba. The incidence of trypanosomiasis was higher (75% [21/28]) among female hip horses; horses with 1-5 years of experience were more susceptible to a T. evansi infection (46.4% [13/28]). In general, farmers on Sumba Island knew of trypanosomiasis (89.8% [79/88]), and 69.3% (61/88) of the farmers reported that their livestock was sick. This study was the first serological study conducted on trypanosomiasis in horses of Sumba Island after the surra outbreak in 2010-2012. There were 3% of farmers who were willing to provide the government with information on implementing a prevention program and controlling the spread of surra on the island. Conclusion: The diagnoses of surra disease were made based on clinical symptoms and parasitological examinations. CATTs could be used to diagnose T. evansi infection in horses."
"Distribution, diversity and drivers of blood-borne parasite co-infections in Alaskan bird populations","Avian species are commonly infected by multiple parasites, however few studies have investigated the environmental determinants of the prevalence of co-infection over a large scale. Here we believe that we report the first, detailed ecological study of the prevalence, diversity and co-infections of four avian blood-borne parasite genera: Plasmodium spp., Haemoproteus spp., Leucocytozoon spp. and Trypanosoma spp. We collected blood samples from 47 resident and migratory bird species across a latitudinal gradient in Alaska. From the patterns observed at collection sites, random forest models were used to provide evidence of associations between bioclimatic conditions and the prevalence of parasite co-infection distribution. Molecular screening revealed a higher prevalence of haematozoa (53%) in Alaska than previously reported. Leucocytozoons had the highest diversity, prevalence and prevalence of co-infection. Leucocytozoon prevalence (35%) positively correlated with Tiypanosoma prevalence (11%), negatively correlated with Haemoproteus prevalence (14%) and had no correlation with Plasmodium prevalence (7%). We found temperature, precipitation and tree cover to be the primary environmental drivers that show a relationship with the prevalence of co-infection. The results provide insight into the impacts of bioclimatic drivers on parasite ecology and intra-host interactions, and have implications for the study of infectious diseases in rapidly changing environments.

Environmental factors associated with American cutaneous leishmaniasis in a new Andean focus in Colombia,"Objective To evaluate the environmental and ecological factors associated with Leishmania transmission and vector abundance in Chaparral, Tolima-Colombia. Methods First, we compared the ecological characteristics, abundance of phlebotomies and potential reservoir hosts in the peridomestic environment (100 m radius) of randomly selected houses, between two townships with high and low cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence. Second, we examined peridomestic correlates of phlebotomine abundance in all 43 houses in the higher risk township. Results The high transmission township had higher coverage of forest (23%vs. 8.4%) and shade coffee (30.7%vs. 11%), and less coffee monoculture (16.8%vs. 26.2%) and pasture (6.3%vs. 12.3%), compared to the low transmission township. Lutzomyia were more abundant in the high transmission township 2.5 vs. 0.2/trap/night. Lutzomyia longiflocosa was the most common species in both townships: 1021/1450 (70%) and 39/80 (49%). Numbers of potential wild mammal reservoirs were small, although four species were found to be infected with Leishmania (Viannia) spp. In the high transmission township, the overall peridomiciliary capture rate of L.similar to longiflocosa was 1.5/trap/night, and the abundance was higher in houses located nearer to forest (? = -0.30, P = 0.05). Conclusion The findings are consistent with a domestic transmission cycle with the phlebotomies dependent on dense vegetation near the house."
"Molecular identification of bloodmeal sources and trypanosomes in Glossina spp., Tabanus spp. and Stomoxys spp. trapped on cattle farm settlements in southwest Nigeria","The interactions of host, vector and parasite in bovine trypanosomiasis transmission cycles in southwest Nigeria are not yet well understood. Trypanosoma (Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae) species infection prevalences and bloodmeal sources were determined in transmitting vectors of the genera Glossina (Diptera: Glossinidae), Tabanus (Diptera: Tabanidae) and Stomoxys (Diptera: Muscidae) collected using Nzi traps in cattle settlements in southwest Nigeria. Sequenced cytochrome B mitochondrial DNA segments obtained from vector digestive tracts identified bloodmeal sources from eight host species, namely human, cattle, hippopotamus, giraffe, gazelle, spotted hyena, long-tailed rat and one unidentified species. Overall, 71.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 63.0-78.1], 33.3% (95% CI 21.9-47.0) and 22.2% (95% CI 16.2-29.9), respectively, of Glossina, Tabanus and Stomoxys flies were positive for trypanosomes. The observed trypanosome species were Trypanosoma vivax, Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma evansi, Trypanosoma simiae and Trypanosoma godfreyi. Trypanosome DNA was more prevalent in tsetse (34.8% Tr. vivax, 51.1% Tr. b. brucei, 5.2% Tr. congolense, 4.4% Tr. simiae and 24.4% mixed infections) than in other flies and the main determinants in all flies were seasonal factors and host availability. To the best of the present group's knowledge, this is the first report of Trypanosoma species in Tabanus and Stomoxys flies in Nigeria. It indicates that vector control programmes should always consider biting flies along with tsetse flies in the control of human and animal trypanosomiasis."
Molecular identification of bovine trypanosomes in relation to cattle sources in southwest Nigeria,"Bovine trypanosomosis is a problem in the livestock industry in Nigeria. A longitudinal survey of cattle sampled during the wet and dry seasons was conducted from April 2016 to March 2017. Blood samples were collected by random sampling from 745 cattle in southwest Nigeria and screened for trypanosomes by internal transcribed spacer-polymerase chain reaction (ITS-PCR). Cattle positive for Trypanozoon DNA were further screened with the Rode Trypanozoon antigen type (RoTat) 1.2 PCR and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense glycoprotein (TgsGP) genes for T. evansi and T. b. gambiense respectively. Trypanosome DNA was amplified in 23.8% (95%CI: 20.8-26.9) of cattle with significantly higher prevalence in wet season (95%CI: 22.9-30.8) when compared to the dry season (95%CI: 14.3-23.6). A high prevalence was observed in Fulani cattle farms 54.1% (95%CI: 42.78-64.93%) while the prevalence was lower in institutional farms 14.7% (95%CI: 10.10-20.97%). Trypanosoma vivax was the most prevalent trypanosome observed (11.54% (95%CI: 9.44-14.04%)), followed by T. congolense 8.5% (95%CI: 6.67-10.67%) T. b. brucei 4.8% (95%CI: 3.51-6.62%) and T. evansi 1.74% (95%CI: 1.02-2.96%). Mixed infections were observed in 2.8% (95%CI: 1.85-4.27%) of cattle. Seasonal variation revealed a predominance of T. congolense and T. vivax in wet and dry season, respectively. The high prevalence of Trypanosoma species in cattle indicates a need for expanded surveillance for AAT in southwest Nigeria. Migration, settlement patterns, increased marketing and management types were some of the risk factors identified for AAT."
"Comparative evaluation of the nested ITS PCR against the 18S PCR-RFLP in a survey of bovine trypanosomiasis in Kwale County, Kenya","We compared the nested internal transcribed spacer (ITS) PCR and the 18S PCR-RFLP (restriction-fragment length polymorphism) pan-trypanosome assays in a cross-sectional survey of bovine trypanosomiasis in 358 cattle in Kwale County, Kenya. The prevalence of trypanosomiasis as determined by the nested ITS PCR was 19.6% (70/358) and by 18S PCR-RFLP was 16.8% (60/358). Of the pathogenic trypanosomes detected, the prevalence of Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax was greater than that of Trypanosoma simiae. The nested ITS PCR detected 83 parasite events, whereas the 18S PCR-RFLP detected 64; however, overall frequencies of infections and the parasite events detected did not differ between the assays ((2) = 0.8, df = 1, p > 0.05 and (2) = 2.5, df = 1, p > 0.05, respectively). The kappa statistic (0.8) showed good agreement between the tests. The nested ITS PCR and the 18S PCR-RFLP had comparable sensitivity, although the nested ITS PCR was better at detecting mixed infections ((2) = 5.4, df = 1, p < 0.05)."
"Livestock farmers' perception and epidemiology of bovine trypanosomosis in Kwale District, Kenya","We did cross-sectional surveys in Kwale District, Kenya to determine the epidemiology of bovine trypanosomosis and livestock owners' perceptions of the disease. The surveys involved relative importance of trypanosomosis, examination of the current disease constraints, current control practices and drug-use patterns. Informal meetings were held with farmers and cattle census undertaken. Tsetse-fly densities and trypanosomosis prevalences in cattle were determined. A total of 132 farmers were interviewed. Trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis, East Coast fever, foot-and-mouth diseases were reported to be the major constraints to livestock production. Trypanosomosis was the most important compared to other diseases. Chemotherapy was the most widely used method of controlling the disease. Farmer-based tsetse-control technologies were poorly adopted. Respondents were quite knowledgeable on the symptoms, causes and treatment of trypanosomosis. Glossina austeni, G. brevipalpis and G. pallidipes were found in the area; the latter was the most common (0.2-738 flies/trap). Trypanosoma congolense and T vivax were found in cattle with the former more prevalent. Infection prevalences in cattle varied between 0 and 25% (median: 22%). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Leishmania in wolves in northern Spain: A spreading zoonosis evidenced by wildlife sanitary surveillance,"Leishmaniosis is, to date, considered the second most important emerging vector-borne protozoal disease in the world after malaria. The form of zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis found in the Mediterranean basin is caused by Leishmania infantum, and its life cycle includes the domestic dog and a phlebotomine sandfly vector. This complex epidemiological cycle and its high prevalence of subclinical infection, hinder the surveillance and control of L. infantum, and allows it to go unnoticed at the geographical endemicity limits of the parasite or in recently colonized areas. We, therefore, tested 102 wolves (Canis lupus) and 47 other wild carnivores in order to detect Leishmania DNA by means of PCR. Samples were collected from 2008 to 2014 in Asturias (northern Spain), a region considered non-endemic for the parasite. The results obtained provided valuable information regarding the prevalence of Leishmania in wild carnivores in Asturias and its geographic distribution in the region: an average prevalence of 33% for wolves and an overall prevalence of 40% for all the wild carnivores studied were reported, with a widespread presence of the parasite in the region and an apparent increase in its prevalence in wolves during the last decade. This suggests the usefulness of the wolf as a sentinel species for the detection and study of Leishmania in the field and confirms the value of wildlife sanitary surveillance programs for the detection and monitoring of hitherto disregarded diseases that affect domestic animals and humans."
PCR-based diagnosis for detection of Leishmania in skin and blood of rodents from an endemic area of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil,"The technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) associated to hybridization was used to screen 123 samples collected from wild and synanthropic rodents captured in a cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis endemic area in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The detection of Leishmania spp in naturally infected rodents is of fundamental importance for incriminating them as possible reservoir hosts of the diseases in Minas Gerais. A total of 62 specimens belonging to wild (Thrichomys apereoides, Oryzomys subflavus, Galea spixii, Bolomys lasiurus and Wiedomys pyrrhorhinos) and synanthropic (R. rattus) rodent species were captured in different ecotopes. Blood and skin samples were submitted for PCR analyses followed by molecular hybridization with specific probes for the three Leishmania-species complexes. Fifteen samples were found positive after PCR-hybridization and identified as follows: nine belonging to the L. mexicana complex, three to the L. braziliensis complex and three to the L. donovani complex. Positive PCR results were found in 11 out of the 61 (18%) blood samples and in four out of the 62 (6.4%) skin fragments screened. R. rattus and T apereoides were the most abundant species in the area also presenting high prevalence of natural infection. The presence of parasite DNA belonging to L. braziliensis, L. mexicana and L. donovani complexes was confirmed in several individuals of a rodent species, R. rattus. This work is the first report of the detection of L. (L.) chagasi in a naturally infected T apereoides. The utility of filter paper as a substrate for PCR analyses and the efficacy of the procedure associated to the hybridization is emphasized. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Antibodies to Leishmania spp. in domestic felines,"Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne zoonotic disease caused by protozoa in the genus Leishmania, typical of rural and peri-urban environments. The causative agent of American visceral leishmaniasis is Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi and the main insect vector in Brazil is Lutzomyia longipalpis. Dogs (Canis familiaris) are important in the transmission of the disease, as a reservoir closely related to humans and an infection source for phlebotomine vectors. Since 1990, an increasing number of feline leishmaniasis cases have been reported, suggesting that domestic cats (Felis catus) might be involved in the epidemiology of the disease. The present study analyzed the prevalence of anti-Leishmania spp. antibodies in naturally infected domestic cats from various neighborhoods in the municipality of Belem, Para, Brazil, using the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and the direct agglutination test (DAT). Among the 443 samples tested, 18 (4.06%) presented positive reactions in the IFA. The observed titers were 40 IU in 4.97% of the samples and 80 IU in 0.90%. In the DAT test, positive results were found in 25 (5.64%) of the samples. The observed titers were also 40 IU (4.97%) and 80 IU (0.68%). The agreement rate between the two tests was considered low (Kappa coefficient = 0.10)."
First report of Trypanosoma vivax infection in dairy cattle from Costa Rica,"An outbreak of haemoparasitoses occurred from October 2007 to July 2008 in cattle from the district of Rio Cuarto, province of Alajuela, Costa Rica. Fifty animals of various ages out of 450 Brown Swiss were affected. The animals presented fever, severe anemia, jaundice, abortion or premature birth, loss of appetite, decrease milk production and accentuated weight loss in a short period of time. Haemoparasites were observed in the blood smears: Anaplasma marginale was present in 17 animals (60.7%): Trypanosoma vivax in nine (32.1%) and Babesia bovis in two (7.1%). Three of the animals (10.7%) had a mixed infection with T. vivax and A. marginale. After treatment, all the animals were clinically recovered and subsequent blood samplings showed no parasites. Data suggest that the outbreak might be related to a decrease in the availability and quality of the pastures due to very heavy rainfalls during the year 2007, as well as an increase in the abundance of Boophilus microplus and Stomoxys calcitrans. This is the first report of the presence of T. vivax in Costa Rica. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

"Molecular diagnosis of the natural infection rate due to Leishmania sp in sandflies (Psychodidae, Lutzomyia) in the Amazon region of Maranhao, Brazil","The natural infection rate due to Leishmania was studied in three different sandfly species using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Leishmania specific primers were designed to examine whether sandfly pools were infected. In total 1,100 female of Lutzomyia choti, were analyzed. Among all the pools examined, four pools of Lutzomyia whitmani were positive, but none of the pools of the other two species were infected. Thus, a total infection rate of 0.4% was established in this study. A similar infection rate was found in previous studies, suggesting that Lutzomyia whitmani transmits Leishmania to mammals in Buriticupu, Maranhao."
PORCINE TRYPANOSOMOSIS IN NIGERIA - INFECTIONS IN LOCAL AND EXOTIC PIGS IN THE NSUKKA AREA OF ANAMBRA STATE,"A twelve-month survey in three Local Government Areas (LGA) in Nsukka zone, Anambra State, Nigeria revealed that out of 150 local and exotic breeds of pig examined, 46 (30.7%) were infected with trypanosomes. Both single and mixed infections of Trypanosoma brucei and T. congolense were observed. However, T. brucei was the predominant trypanosome encountered. The husbandry system in practice was the most significant factor influencing the prevalence of trypanosomes in the pigs. In addition significantly higher prevalences were recorded during the rainy seasons. Clinical trypanosomosis was encountered in only eight of the 46 positive cases seen, with anaemia, loss of weight and anoestrus being the most important effects associated with these infections. The pathogenic and economic significance of these findings are discussed."
Molecular identification of trypanosomes in tsetse flies trapped from Onicha Ugbo in Delta state of Nigeria,"The delta region of Southern Nigeria is believed to be endemic for animal trypanosomiasis. Occasionally, cases of suspected human trypanosomiasis based on clinical presentation have been reported, thus we undertook survey of tsetse flies from the area with the purposes of typing the trypanosomes in the locality and demonstrating the possibility that human trypanosomiasis may be present in the area if the vector Trypanosoma gambiense is seen. A total of 429 flies were trapped; all were of Glossina palpalis palpalis specie. Sixty or 14.0% of them were found to be infected by trypanosomes. The infection rates were 7.7%, 1.6%, 1.6% and 6.3% for Trypanosoma vivax, Trypanosoma brucei brucei, Trypanosoma simiae and Trypanosoma congolense respectively. Mixed infections in various combinations were observed. There was no evidence of human infective Trypanosoma gambiense. The presence of various species of animal trypanosomes even as mixed infections confirms that the area is indeed endemic for animal trypanosomiasis. The simultaneous occurrence of Glossina palpalis. palpalis and Trypanosoma brucei brucei, however, makes it imperative to monitor the area continuously for human trypanosomiasis."
Hematological and Plasma Biochemistry of the Adult Wild African Grasscutter (Thryonomys swinderianus) A Zoonosis Factor in the Tropical Humid Rain Forest of Southeast Nigeria,"Hematological and plasma biochemical values of wild grasscutters were evaluated to determine their potential to transmit zoonotic pathogens. Three 5-ml, blood samples were collected from each of 1000 grasscutters caught in the wild for hematology, biochemical, and parasitological tests. Hematological and biochemical values were compared with those from captive-reared grasscutters. There are significantly (P < 0.05) higher lymphocyte, eosinophil, and basophil values for wild grasscutters compared to those that are captive reared. Parasitological examination revealed a 15% prevalence of blood protozoa in the wild grasscutters. Blood pathogens encountered were Trypanosoma sp. (66.7%) and Plasmodium sp. (33.3%), with 20.7% mixed infection. Sex does not significantly (P > 0.05) affect blood protozoa infection, while season does. We therefore concluded that wild grasscutters serve as efficient reservoir hosts for agents of African trypanosomiasis and malaria in the tropical humid rainforest region of Nigeria."

A comparative study of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in sylvatic mammals from a protected and a disturbed area in the Argentine Chaco,"Understanding the complex epidemiology of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycles requires comparative studies in widely different environments. We assessed the occurrence of T. cruzi infection in sylvatic mammals, their infectiousness to the vector, and parasite genotypes in a protected area of the Argentine Chaco, and compared them with information obtained similarly in a nearby disturbed area. A total of 278 mammals from >23 species in the protected area were diagnosed for T. cruzi infection using xenodiagnosis, kDNA-PCR and nuclear satellite DNA-PCR (SAT) from blood samples. The relative abundance and species composition differed substantially between areas. Didelphis albiventris opossums were less abundant in the protected area; had a significantly lower body mass index, and a stage structure biased toward earlier stages. The capture of armadillos was lower in the protected area. The composite prevalence of T. cruzi infection across host species was significantly lower in the protected area (11.1%) than in the disturbed area (22.1%), and heterogeneous across species groups. The prevalence of infection in D. albiventris and Thylamys pusilla opossums was significantly lower in the protected area (nil for D. albiventris), whereas infection in sigmodontine rodents was three times higher in the protected area (17.5 versus 5.7%). Parasite isolates from the two xenodiagnosis-positive mammals (1 Dasypus novemcinctus and 1 Conepatus chinga) were typed as TcIII; both specimens were highly infectious to Triatoma infestans. Fat-tailed opossums, bats and rodents were kDNA-PCR-positive and xenodiagnosis-negative. Desmodus rotundus and Myotis bats were found infected with T. cruzi for the first time in the Gran Chaco.

Vector Incrimination of Sand Flies in the Most Important Visceral Leishmaniasis Focus in Iran,"The prevalence, host preference, and rate of Leishmania spp. infection of sand fly species are important parameters for incrimination of parasite vectors. We applied polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods to detect Leishmania spp. parasites and blood meals within individual sand flies ill the most important visceral leishmaniasis (VL) focus in northwestern Iran. Leishmania spp. minicircles (kinetoplast DNA) were found in 14 (0.9%) of 1,569 female specimens. Sequence analysis of 650 basepairs of an internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA gene identified L. infantum/L. donovani in 12 specimens and L. adleri-like parasites in 2 specimens. Nine (64.3%) of 14 of the Leishmania spp.-positive sand flies were Phlebotomies perfeliewi transcaucasicus. Blood meal identification of host DNA within sand flies by PCR-based and ELISA methods showed that 30% and 28%, respectively, were positive for human blood. Results of this study showed that P. perfeliewi transcaucasicus is the most prevalent, infected, and anthropophagic sand fly and plays a major role in VL transmission in the region studied."
Feline and canine leishmaniosis and other vector-borne diseases in the Aeolian Islands: Pathogen and vector circulation in a confined environment,"Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are prevalently investigated in dogs. Studies on feline VBDs are scant, though feline leishmaniosis (FeL) is increasingly recognised as a disease of cats in endemic areas. Comprehensive investigations on the distribution of VBDs in populations of cats and dogs living in relatively small geographical areas, such as islands, are currently lacking. In this study the prevalence of Leishmania infantum and other VBD pathogens was assessed in cohorts of cats and dogs living in the Aeolian Islands. Autochthonous animals (330 cats and 263 dogs) of different age and sex were sampled. Blood and conjunctival samples were collected from cats and dogs for serological and molecular testing. Eighty-five (25.8%) cats were positive for L. infantum, 13 (3.9%) for Bartonella spp. and 1 (0.3%) for Hepatozoon felis. One-hundred and ten dogs (41.8%) were positive for L. infantum and three (1.1%) for Hepatozoon canis. The incidence of L. infantum infection in cats positive after one season of exposure to sand fly was 14.7%. Leishmania infantum prevalence and year incidence were higher in dogs than in cats (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0003, respectively). Thirty-four cats (10.3%) scored positive for ticks (mean intensity rate of infestation, 2.03 +/- 1.4), which were identified to the species level as Ixodes ventalloi and Rhipicephalus pusillus. Conversely, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.I.) was the only species identified in dogs (10.6%). A larger prevalence of infestation by Ctenocephalides felis was recorded in cats (n = 91; 27.6%) than in dogs (n = 33; 12.5%) (p = 0.0001). In addition, one female Nosopsyllus fasciatus (syn. Ceratophyllus fasciatus) and one male Spilopsyllus cuniculi were also identified in flea-infected cats. VBDs are endemic in the Aeolian Islands being L. infantum the most prevalent vector-borne pathogen circulating between cats and dogs. The overall seroprevalence of FeL herein recorded is higher than that assessed, only by IFAT, in populations of cats in Greece and in Spain. Because L infantum and VBDs are more commonly associated with dogs, the recognition of cats as hosts of different vector-borne pathogens is of paramount importance towards a better management of these diseases in both animals and humans.

Diagnosis of Canine Vector-Borne Diseases in Young Dogs: a Longitudinal Study,"Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) pose a diagnostic challenge, particularly when a dog is coinfected with more than one pathogen. The purpose of this study was to generate information about the diagnosis of CVBDs in young dogs following their first exposure to flea, tick, sand fly, louse, and mosquito vectors. From March 2008 to May 2009, 10 purpose-bred young naive beagle dogs and a cohort of 48 mixed-breed dogs living in an area to which CVBD is endemic in southern Italy were monitored using different diagnostic tests (cytology, serology, and PCR). Overall, PCR detected the highest number of dogs infected with Anaplasma platys, Babesia vogeli, and Ehrlichia canis, whereas seroconversion was a more sensitive indicator of exposure to Leishmania infantum. For A. platys infection, combining blood and buffy coat cytology in parallel enhanced the relative sensitivity (SErel) (87.3%). For B. vogeli, the best diagnostic combination was buffy coat cytology and serology used in parallel (SErel, 67.5%), whereas serology and PCR used in parallel (SErel, 100%) was the best combination for L. infantum. Overall, 12 (20.7%) dogs were coinfected; however, the percentage of new coinfections decreased from baseline (50%) to the first (33.3%) and second (16.6%) follow-up time points. Numbers of coinfections with A. platys and B. vogeli were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than coinfections with other pathogen combinations. The data generated in this study provide insights on the incidence of certain pathogens infecting young dogs in southern Italy, highlight important diagnostic testing limitations, and support the use of multiple diagnostic modalities when attempting to confirm a tick-borne infection in an individual dog or in a canine population."
Does Pathogen Spillover from Commercially Reared Bumble Bees Threaten Wild Pollinators?,"The conservation of insect pollinators is drawing attention because of reported declines in bee species and the 'ecosystem services' they provide. This issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout North America (so called, 'Colony Collapse Disorder'); yet, we still have little understanding of the cause(s) of bee declines. Wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen 'spillover' from commercially reared bumble bees, which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops, is a possible cause. We constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and, using laboratory experiments and the literature, estimated parameter values for the spillover of Crithidia bombi, a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial Bombus. We also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover, and compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in the field. Our model predicts that, during the first three months of spillover, transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse. However, a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly, infecting up to 35-100% of wild Bombus, and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk. In the field, although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection, the prevalences of C. bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model. Indeed, we found that spillover has allowed C. bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses. Given the available evidence, it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild Bombus in North America. Improved management of domestic bees, for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners, could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover."
A panel of microsatellite and minisatellite markers for the characterisation of field isolates of Theileria parva,"Mini- and microsatellite sequences show high levels of variation and therefore provide excellent tools for both the genotyping and population genetic analysis of parasites. Herein we describe the identification of a panel of 11 polymorphic microsatellites and 49 polymorphic minisatellites of the protozoan haemoparasite Theileria parva. The PCR products were run on high resolution Spreadex gels on which the alleles were identified and sized. The sequences of the mini- and microsatellites were distributed across the four chromosomes with 16 on chromosome 1, 12 on chromosome 2, 14 on chromosome 3 and 18 on chromosome 4. The primers from the 60 sequences were tested against all the Theileria species that co-infect cattle in East and Southern Africa and were found to be specific for T parva. In order to demonstrate the utility of these markers, we characterised eight tissue culture isolates of T. parva isolated from cattle in widely separated regions of Eastern and Southern Africa (one from Zambia, one from Uganda, two from Zimbabwe, four from Kenya) and one Kenyan tissue culture isolate from Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer). The numbers of alleles per locus range from three to eight indicating a high level of diversity between these geographically distinct isolates. We also analysed five isolates from cattle on a single farm at Kakuzi in the central highlands of Kenya and identified a range of one to four alleles per locus. Four of the Kakuzi isolates represented distinct multilocus genotypes while two exhibited identical multilocus genotypes. This indicates a high level of diversity in a single population of T parva. Cluster analysis of multilocus genotypes from the 14 isolates (using a neighbour joining algorithm) revealed that genetic similarity between isolates was not obviously related to their geographical origin.

Transmission of visceral leishmaniasis through blood transfusions from infected English Foxhounds to anemic dogs,"Objective-To conduct serologic surveillance for Leishmania spp in English Foxhounds from a kennel, as well as recipients of blood from these dogs, and determine whether L infantum organisms could be transmitted via blood transfusion. Design-Serologic prevalence survey. Animals-120 English Foxhounds and 51 dogs of various breeds receiving blood from these donors. Procedure-Foxhound blood donors, foxhound nondonors, and nonfoxhound blood recipient dogs were evaluated serologically for Leishmania spp by indirect fluorescent antibody testing. Dogs that received packed RBC (PRBC) transfusions from foxhound donors from mid-1996 through mid-2000 were identified. Furthermore, dogs were serologically evaluated if they had received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions in 1999 and 2000 from seropositive foxhound blood donors. Results-Thirty percent of the English Foxhounds were seropositive for Leishmania spp (titer greater than or equal to 1:16), although the degree of seropositivity varied considerably during the period. Furthermore, 57 foxhounds had been used as donors from 1996 to 2000, and 342 units of PRBC had been transfused to at least 227 patients. All 25 dogs screened that received PRBC from seronegative foxhound donors tested negative, whereas 3 of 7 dogs that received PRBC from seropositive donors tested positive. All 9 dogs that received FFP from seropositive foxhound donors remained seronegative. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-To our knowledge, this report documents the first transmission of Leishmania spp by blood transfusion. The use of foxhounds as blood donors may not be advisable in North America."
Occurrence and transmission of camel trypanosomiasis in northern Kenya,"Camel trypanosomiasis was confirmed in selected northern Kenya herds using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Mouse Inoculation (Ml) and Blood Smear (BS) techniques. The ELISA results indicated current or past trypanosome prevalence rates of 72-95%. Ml and BS techniques revealed current infection rates up to 19.2 and 11.5%, respectively. Trypanosome infection rates were significantly elevated during the wet season based on the Ml diagnostic technique. The mean infection rates were 13.7 +/- 5 and 4.55 +/- 2.2 for the wet and dry season, respectively. There were no seasonal differences in infection rates in camels based on the ELISA technique. Active transmission of camel traypanosomiasis was ascertained by regular monitoring of 10 sentinel camels. Three of these sentinel camels became infected 8-9 months after introduction, which in the absence of Glossina spp., supported the concept of mechanical transmission. The trypanosome species involved was confirmed to be Trypanosoma evansi Steele from a preliminary survey."
"A survey on canine leishmaniasis in western Turkey by parasite, DNA and antibody detection assays","Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum is found throughout the Mediterranean Region, including Turkey, where dogs are considered to be the main reservoir host for this parasite. In the district of Manisa, western Turkey, 37 human VL cases were reported from June 1993-August 1997. Twenty-four villages in this district were chosen for a survey of disease prevalence in dogs. The dogs, 490 in total, were examined using either the indirect immunofluoresence assay (IFAT) or direct agglutination test (DAT). Anti-Leishmania antibodies were found by at least one test in 5.3% (26/490) of the dogs. Infections were confirmed by parasitological examination of or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on lymph node aspirates in 65% (13/20) and 76.4% (13/17) of the seropositive dogs tested, respectively. The confirmation rate was 85% by combining the results of PCR and microscopy. Our results demonstrate that canine VL is wide spread in western Turkey where human VL is endemic, and that serodiagnosis is a valuable tool for monitoring the infection.

"Canine infection and the possible role of dogs in the transmission of American tegumentary leishmaniosis in Salta, Argentina","Some Leishmania species affect humans in two principal forms: visceral and cutaneous leishmaniosis (CL). Several studies have identified dogs as the main reservoirs of the visceral leishmaniosis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum. The purpose of this work was to carry out a survey of the canine population associated with human cases of American tegumentary leishmaniosis (ATL), in order to establish the clinical, parasitological, serological and immunological characteristics of the canine disease, in an endemic region for both ATL and Chagas' disease in the province of Salta, in northwestern Argentina. Two hundred and eight dogs from the endemic area were examined and 41 (19.7%) of them presented lesions compatible with leishmaniosis. In order to investigate the presence of antibodies against Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi, sera were screened by ELISA using two complex antigens from these parasites and, because of cross-reactions between them, a specific antigen for diagnosis of T cruzi infection. Sixty-two (29.8%) of 208 dogs were positive for the complex antigen F45 from Leishmania and 50 (24%) were positive for the complex antigen F105 from T cruzi. Nine dogs (4.3%) were positive for the specific Ag163B6-cruzipain suggesting that these dogs were truly infected with T cruzi. Furthermore, three of these nine dogs presented Leishmania sp. in their skin lesions and therefore were considered as infected by both, T cruzi and Leishmania parasites. The prevalence of Leishmania infection detected by lesions and/or positive serology was 27.4% (57/208). On the basis of previous observations regarding the clustered appearance of human ATL, the dog population was divided into two groups: zone A, dogs living within a 100 m radius from houses with human cases, and zone B, dogs living beyond this limit. The prevalence of ATL in dogs was significantly higher in zone A (34.6%) than in zone B (7.3%), suggesting a strong correlation between canine and human cases. The average time required for a parasitological diagnosis by microscopy was six times longer for dog samples than human ones, and the average number of parasites per 100 microscopic fields was 14-fold lower in canine samples. The high prevalence of Leishmania infection and the close association with human cases, demonstrated that dogs are a very susceptible host for Leishmania infection, but the scarcity of parasites in their lesions suggests that they may not be the main reservoir of the parasite in this endemic area.

Prevalence and incidence density of Mycobacterium leprae and Trypanosoma cruzi infections within a population of wild nine-banded armadillos,"A total of 415 wild 9-banded armadillos from the East Atchafalaya River Levee (Point Coupee, LA) were collected over 4 years to estimate the incidence and prevalence of Mycobacterium leprae and Trypanosoma cruzi and to discern any relationship between the 2 agents. M. leprae infections were maintained at a high steady prevalence rate year to year averaging 19%. T cruzi antibody prevalence remained relatively low, averaging 3.9%, and varied markedly between years. Prevalence rates were independent, with only 3 armadillos coinfected with both agents. M. leprae incidence density ranged from 0.47 to 3.5 cases per 1,000 animal-days, depending on case definition, confirming active intense transmission of M. leprae among armadillos. No incident T. cruzi cases were found. These infections seem to occur independently and may be used in comparisons to understand better factors that may influence transmission of these agents."
"Serological Evidence of Infection by Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum (Synonym: Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi) in Free-Ranging Wild Mammals in a Nonendemic Region of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil","Concerns about the interface between wildlife, domestic animals, and humans in the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) have been growing due to natural or anthropogenic environmental changes. In this context, investigations of the infection in wild mammals are important to assess their exposure to the vector and the parasite. A study of anti-Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum antibodies was carried out using the direct agglutination test (DAT) on 528 free-ranging wild mammals of 38 species from the region of Botucatu, state of SAo Paulo, Brazil, a municipality that has no records of the vector or of human or canine autochthony. Antibodies were detected, with a cutoff of 1:320, in 9/528 (1.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-2.8%) mammals of the species Callithrix jacchus, Lepus europaeus, Sphiggurus villosus, Nasua nasua, Eira barbara, and Galictis cuja, with high titers (1280) for the last three. These three are little-studied species, and previous records of the detection of anti-Leishmania spp. antibodies in Brazil exist only for coatis (N. nasua), whereas worldwide, infection by L. (L.) infantum has been confirmed only in hares (Le. europaeus). On the other hand, opossums and canids, the species most commonly reported to be naturally infected by L. (L.) infantum, were not seropositive. Fifty-eight (58/528; 10.9%) mammals were found to have antibody titers ranging from 20 to 160 and were not included among the seropositive animals due to the adopted cutoff. However, the possibility of infection in these animals should not be discarded, because there is no standard cutoff point for the different wild species. Our findings indicate the need for investigations into the exact role of the seropositive species in the epidemiology of VL and for effective epidemiological surveillance to prevent its expansion, because even in regions where there are no records of canine or human autochthonous cases, there may be parasite circulation among wild mammals."
MOLECULAR STUDY OF CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS HUMAN RESERVOIRS AND INFECTIONS IN BASTAK,"Introduction: Leishmaniasis is one the six most important diseases in tropical areas. Study and research on various aspects of it is recommended and supported by the World Health Organization. Broom tail rodents (Rodentia: Muridae: Gerbillinae) are the most important reservoir hosts of parasite causes wet cutaneous leishmaniasis (or Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) disease) means leishmania major. Different species of rodents from different regions of Iran play role in maintenance of the parasite. The purpose of this research is molecular study of cutaneous leishmaniasis human reservoirs and infections in Bastak County, Hormozgan Province, Iran. Materials and Methods: Live traps were used to catch rodents. The rodents were anesthetized with chloroform in the field and four slides were prepared from earlobe of each animal by sanding method and their morphometric characteristics were completely measured and recorded. Rodent abdomen was opened with blade and the liver and the spleen of each sample were kept in a numbered container containing 70% ethanol. The prepared slides were examined with microscopic (Giemsa staining) and molecular methods. Finally, using Nested-PCR method, they were evaluated using species-specific primers (LIN R4, LIN 17, LIN 19). Results: A total of 108 rodents from five species of three different genera were collected. Meriones persicus species with 26.9% was the predominant species. A contamination in T. indica species and two cases of contamination in two samples of female M. hurrianae were observed. L. major species was also identified. Conclusions: Broom tail rodents are abundance and have relatively high diversity in Bastak County. They live in proximity to human dwellings. Tatera indica and Merioneshurrianae species are introduced as the disease reservoir hosts in this area and use of molecular and PCR methods provides the possibility of faster diagnosis of parasite species."
"A survey of zoonotic pathogens carried by house mouse and black rat populations in Yucatan, Mexico","The house mouse (Mus musculus) and the black rat (Rattus rattus) are reservoir hosts for zoonotic pathogens, several of which cause neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Studies of the prevalence of these NTD-causing zoonotic pathogens, in house mice and black rats from tropical residential areas are scarce. Three hundred and two house mice and 161 black rats were trapped in 2013 from two urban neighbourhoods and a rural village in Yucatan, Mexico, and subsequently tested for Trypanosoma cruzi, Hymenolepis diminuta and Leptospira interrogans. Using the polymerase chain reaction we detected T. cruzi DNA in the hearts of 4.9% (8/165) and 6.2% (7/113) of house mice and black rats, respectively. We applied the sedimentation technique to detect eggs of H. diminuta in 0.5% (1/182) and 14.2% (15/106) of house mice and black rats, respectively. Through the immunofluorescent imprint method, L. interrogans was identified in 0.9% (1/106) of rat kidney impressions. Our results suggest that the black rat could be an important reservoir for T. cruzi and H. diminuta in the studied sites. Further studies examining seasonal and geographical patterns could increase our knowledge on the epidemiology of these pathogens in Mexico and the risk to public health posed by rodents."
"Epidemiology of Babesia, Anaplasma and Trypanosoma species using a new expanded reverse line blot hybridization assay","Vector-borne hemoparasitic infections are a major problem that affects livestock industries worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. In this work, a reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay was developed for the simultaneous detection and identification of Anaplasma, Babesia and bovine trypanosomes, encompassing in this way the most relevant hemoparasites that affect cattle. A total of 186 bovine blood samples collected from two different ecoepidemiological regions of northeast Argentina, with and without tick control, were analyzed with this new RLB. High diversity of parasites, such as Babesia bovis, B. bigemina, Anaplasma marginale and three different Trypanosoma species, was found. High rates of coinfections were also detected, and significant differences were observed not only in the prevalence of parasites but also in the level of coinfections between the two analyzed areas. Regarding the Trypanosoma genus, we provide molecular evidence of the presence of T. vivax and T. theileri for the first time in Argentina. Besides, since the RLB is a prospective tool, it allowed the identification of a yet unknown bovine trypanosome which could not be assigned to any of the bovine species known so far. In the present study we provide new insights on the prevalence of several pathogens that directly impact on livestock production in Argentina. The RLB assay developed here allows to identify simultaneously numerous pathogenic species which can also be easily expanded to detect other blood borne pathogens. These characteristics make the RLB hybridization assay an essential tool for epidemiological survey of all vector-borne pathogens."
Human and canine leishmaniasis in asymptomatic and symptomatic population in Northwestern Greece,"The occurrence of human and canine Mediterranean visceral leishmaniasis (MVL) in Northwestern Greece was investigated during an 8-year survey (1994-2001). A total of 1200 blood sera samples, collected from asymptomatic human population, and 1200 blood sera samples from asymptomatic dogs were screened for Leishmania infantum, antibodies using the indirect immunofluorescence test (IFA). Also during the survey 111 human subjects and 350 canines were referred as clinically suspect cases for MVL. Significant differences (p = 0.001) were found between the prevalence of MVL in symptomatic and asymptomatic human populations (12.6 and 0.5%, respectively), but a more modest difference was observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic canines (45.4 and 24.4%, respectively). From the results, it appears that Greece has a high background of canine leishmaniasis, which is likely to be a risk factor for the emergence of human MVL. (C) 2004 The British Infection Society.

Cross-Sectional Serosurvey and Risk Factors Associated with the Presence of Toxoplasma gondii Antibodies in Pigs in Greece,"Introduction: Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide reported zoonotic infection caused by the protozoon Toxoplasma gondii. Pigs may become infected by ingesting feed or water contaminated with cat faeces, by cannibalism, and/or by eating infected rodents. T. gondii infected edible tissues of pigs are a source of infection for humans. This study was undertaken to detect seropositivity of pigs against T. gondii and identify possible risk factors as well as to compare two serological methods. Methods: A total of 609 blood samples were collected from 10% of the sows from 65 pig farms located in mainland Greece. Information about the geographical location, size, and biosecurity level of the herd was recorded. Samples were tested for the presence of antibodies against T. gondii employing the indirect fluorescent antibody test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Twenty-six positive samples were detected (4.3%) in 17 out of the 65 farms tested (26.2%). The average seroprevalence in affected herds was 26.8% (95% confidence interval 21.0-32.6%). Among the categorical data evaluated, the biosecurity level (odds ratio 0.17, p<0.01) and the geographical characteristics (odds ratio 13.55, p<0.05) significantly affected the presence of toxoplasmosis in the herd. Toxoplasmosis was recorded in significantly higher percentages in mountainous farms as compared to lowlands (p<0.05) and in those with poor biosecurity levels than in those with very good (p<0.05). A very good agreement (=0.958) was observed between the two serological methods. Conclusion: The presence of antibodies in pigs is indirect information on the risk of the infection and an indication of the necessity of biosecurity measures to be taken in order to control infection at least in the areas at highest risk."
Incidences of canine leishmaniasis in an endemic area of southern Italy,"Canine leishmaniasis (CanL), caused by Leishmania infantum, is widely distributed in many Mediterranean countries and is considered endemic in southern and central Italy with prevalence reaching up to 48.4%. Determination of the incidence would be useful as a measure of the risk of infection, then to evaluate the usefulness of control measures and to estimate whether a new focus is autochthonous or imported. This study was performed on two sites in the Apulia region of southern Italy, namely sites A and B. A total of 262 dogs were included in the evaluation of incidence, 94 farm dogs from site A and 168 dogs (92 farm and 76 kennel dogs) from site B. The incidence of infection was determined by using two different approaches: in site A by means of incidence density rate (IDR); in site B by the yearly seroconversion rate. In site A, the IDR was calculated at 4.25% dog-years; in site B the yearly incidence rate was of 9.52% (6.5% and 13.1% in farm and kennel dogs, respectively). The strength and weakness of the two different approaches (i.e. annual monitoring or monthly interval monitoring) for calculating the incidence of CanL in an endemic area have been discussed."
A cross-sectional serodiagnostic survey of canine leishmaniasis due to Leishmania chagasi,"Jequie, a community of about 144,500 inhabitants located in the State of Bahia, Brazil, is endemic for both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniases. In the present epidemiologic study, the urban and inhabited periurban areas of the town were divided into 140 clusters of 0.25 km(2) each. The seroprevalence of canine Leishmania antibodies was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as a screening test since its sensitivity was significantly higher than that of an indirect immunofluorescence assay, A total of 1,681 dogs was surveyed in 34 randomly sampled clusters. The overall prevalence of Leishmania antibodies in the dog population was 23.5%, with intracluster prevalences ranging from 0% to 67%. There was no correlation of these seroprevalences with the intracluster densities of canine populations, or with the distances from individual clusters to the town center. Moreover, the Leishmania transmission did not seem to follow any clear-cut spatial pattern, since large disparities in the seroprevalences of contiguous clusters were found. Curiously, human cases of visceral leishmaniasis have never been observed in some clusters with a relatively high prevalence of canine seroprevalences. Eight parasite isolates from seropositive dogs were found to belong to the same serodeme and zymodeme as Leishmania (L.) chagasi. The implications of these findings with respect to the epidemiology and control of American visceral leishmaniasis are discussed."
Unraveling cryptic epizootiology of equid trypanosomosis in Punjab state of India by parasitological and sero-molecular techniques,"To unravel equid trypanosomosis caused by Trypanosoma evansi in Punjab state of India, a cross sectional study was designed by utilizing parasitological and sero-molecular tools with objective to assess the prevalence of T. evansi in association with various risk factors in all agroclimatic zones of Punjab state of India. Parasitological Romanowksy stained thin blood smears (RSTBS) to detect patent infection, molecular techniques polymerase chain reaction I (PCR I; TBR 1/2 primers; targeting minichromosomal satellite DNA of T. evansi), polymerase chain reaction II (PCR II; TR 3/4 primers; targeting variable surface glycoprotein region DNA of T. evansi) & LAMP (Loop mediated isothermal amplification) assay to detect latent infection and serological assays card agglutination test (CATT/T. evansi) & ELISA (Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) to detect exposure status of trypanosomosis were utilized in the present study. A total 429 equid blood and serum samples from all the five agroclimatic zones of Punjab state tested by these techniques showed a prevalence of 1.39% (CL: 0-15.28) by RSTBS, 6.52% (10.94-45.09) by both TBR 1/2 PCR and LAMP assay, 5.82% (11.57-38.42) by TR 3/4 PCR, 15.15% (36.57-135.42) with CATT/T. evansi and 22.84% (17.77-840.22) with ELISA. Interpretation of various risk factors revealed that the donkey/mules population (RR = 5.46, 95% [CI] = 0.15-15.56) was found to be at higher risk of T. evansi infection predominantly at 'unorganized' farms (RR = 4.06, 95% [CI] = 0.12-4.51). Animal used for commercial purposes (RR = 3.25, 95% [CI] = 0.06-7.42), rearing of equids with other domestic animals (RR = 2.36, 95% [CI] = 0.10-17.11) and farms without application of fly repellant/insecticides/net (RR = 3.68, 95% [CI] = 0.08-5.94) made them more prone to the disease. This comprehensive report utilizing the classical, serological and molecular diagnostic tools for epidemiology of T. evansi establishes the endemic stability of this infection in all agro climatic zones of Punjab with LAMP assay to be a promisingly sensitive and specific technique for the diagnosis of T. evansi under isothermal conditions in field situations."
"Prevalence of Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs in Chapare, Bolivia","Data on Leishmania spp. infection in dogs in Bolivia is scarce. Dogs from an area where 90% of human cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases are due to Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis were screened for Leishmania infection using established enzyme-linked immunosorbent antibody test (ELISA) protocols. Although none of the 51 dogs surveyed had clinical lesions indicative of CL, 6 out of 51 (11.8%) sampled dogs tested positive by ELISA. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
The relative contributions of host density and genetic diversity on prevalence of a multi-host parasite in bumblebees,
Occurrence of low density of Leishmania infantum in sandflies from a new focus of visceral leishmaniasis in northwest of Iran,"Background & objectives: Observations and case studies have shown that the number of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) cases have increased in the recent years in several areas of Iran including Sarab district, East Azerbaijan province. Sarab district has been considered as a new focus of VL in Iran. The density of the sandfly vector and the Leishmania parasites causing infection has been assessed in 2009. Methods: Sandfly species had been collected from Sarab district, East Azerbaijan province in 2009 using sticky papers and CDC traps. DNA of sandflies was extracted and nested PCR was amplified in a region of the ribosomal. RNA amplicon of Leishmania (ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene), which was shown to be species-specific by DNA sequence. Results: Altogether, 1317 male and female sandflies were trapped. At least 10 different sandfly species were identified morphologically. Leishmania infantum was the only Leishmania that was detected among the sandfly's population in Sarab district. All the infectious cases (4/223) found in the abundant sandfly region were Phlebotomus kandelakii. Conclusion: The diversity of sandflies was similar to those in the main VL focal points in Iran, but the diversity of parasite and density were significantly lower. The low prevalence of VL in Sarab district might be explained by the scarcity of infected domestic dogs Canis familiaris the primary reservoir host of VL in the region. By finding the L. infantum in P. kandelakii for the first time on this new focus, we are able to conclude that P. kandelakii might be the vector of L. infantum. In future, more works should be done to test status of P. kandelakii as a proven vector of L. infantum."
Detection of Leishmania major and Leishmania tropica in domestic cats in the Ege Region of Turkey,"Leishmaniosis is a group of diseases caused by different species of Leishmania parasites in mammalian species. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of Leishmania spp. DNA in cats using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays targeting internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) and heat-shock protein 70 gene (Hsp70) regions with Leishmania species-specific primers and probes. Blood samples were collected from 147 cats (73 female; 74 male) in the endemic regions for zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in the western provinces of Turkey and analyzed using two RT-PCR assays. Additionally, Hsp70 RT-PCR products were sequenced. ELISA assays for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) were also carried out for 145 of the 147 samples. Overall, 13/147(8.84%) cats were positive for Leishmania by RT-PCR (4 L. major and 9 L. tropica). FIV and FeLV antibody and/or antigen was detected in 4 and 5 cats among Leishmania DNA positives, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate and report the presence of L. major and L. tropica infections in a large group of domestic cats in Turkey. The results obtained indicate that species identification of Leishmania is essential for epidemiological understanding and that clinical signs alone are not indicative for leishmaniosis in cats, as it is in dogs. This study suggests that extensive research should be carried out in cat populations in order to fully understand the role of cats in the epidemiology of the disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Genetic Diversity and Prevalence of Leishmania mexicana in Bichromomyia olmeca olmeca 1 in an Endemic Area of Mexico,
High prevalence of infection with Leishmania (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae) in dogs in northern Colombia,"Introduction: Although the dog is considered to be the main domestic reservoir of Leishmania infantum in several Latin American countries, the rate of infection with Leishmania parasites remains unknown in dogs from foci of visceral leishmaniasis of northern of Colombia. Objetive: To determine the prevalence of Leishmania infection in canine population from department of Sucre in northern Colombia. Materials and methods: The canine population of rural areas of the municipalities of Sincelejo, Sampues and Ovejas was studied. Parasites of the genus Leishmania were detected by amplifying a DNA segment of the small ribosomal subunit (rSSU). The relationship among sex, age group and clinical signs with infection by Leishmania was analyzed. Results: A 561 bp fragment of the Leishmania rSSU was amplified in 34.9% (29/83), 35.7% (15/42) and 11.1% (1/9) of the dogs analyzed from Sincelejo, Sampues and Ovejas, respectively. Overall prevalence of Leishmania infection was 33.6%. A 650 bp band, characteristic of parasites of the genus Trypanosoma, was amplified in two dogs from Sincelejo and Sampues and in one dog from Ovejas. The 64.2% of the dogs that showed clinical signs compatible with canine leishmaniasis, was PCR-positive. A statistically significant relationship was found between dogs over 33 months old and positivity to Leishmania (p=0.043). No relationship was observed between sex and positivity to Leishmania (p=0.85). Conclusion: A third of the canine population studied is infected with Leishmania, which could support its potential role as a source of infection for the insect vector."
Evaluation of various diagnostic techniques for Trypanosoma evansi infections in naturally infected camels,"One hundred and eight camels (Camelus dromedarius) from Trypanosoma evansi endemic areas of the Thar Desert of Rajasthan State, India, were evaluated by various diagnostic tests including parasitological tests (wet blood film-WBF, stained thick blood film), chemical test (mercuric chloride), biological test (mouse subinoculation-MSI), and immunodiagnostic tests based on antibody detection (double immunodiffusion test-DID, card agglutination test CATT), antigen detection (double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay Ag-ELISA). Of the tested camels 49 were found infected using the WBF of which nine gave false negative results with the mercuric chloride test. The efficacy of MSI was 87.03 percent, while the mercuric chloride test was 60.18 percent efficient. The diagnostic efficacy of CATT (72.22 percent) was found to be much better than DID (28.70 percent). Ag-ELISA was 86.11 percent efficient in detecting trypanosomal antigens. A good correlation was found between the positive results obtained by wet blood film, CATT and Ag-ELISA. It was inferred that CATT can be used to study the seroprevalence of T. evansi with great ease, however, trypanosome antigen detection may give a more accurate idea of the prevalence of T. evansi in an endemic area."
"TRYPANOSOMA-EVANSI INFECTION IN CATTLE, BUFFALOS AND HORSES IN INDONESIA","Cattle, buffaloes and horses in several areas of Indonesia were examined for evidence of infection with Trypanosoma evansi by the microhaematocrit centrifugation technique (MHCT) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of antibodies to T. evansi. Evidence of infection was found in animals at each sampling site although differences were seen in prevalence rates between sites. Prevalence rates in buffalo were usually higher than in cattle in the same area while in horses they were much lower than in cattle or buffalo. An age-dependent prevalence rate was seen in buffalo and cattle with the highest rates seen in animals older than 2 years. These results concur with the view that T. evansi infection is widespread throughout most of the livestock-producing areas of Indonesia. The apparent lack of any obvious disease owing to T. evansi infection in the sampled animals suggests that a form of stability exists in most endemic areas which serves to ameliorate the effect of T. evansi infection and has an immunological basis linked to the parasite's limited antigenic diversity."
"AN OUTBREAK OF TRYPANOSOMIASIS CAUSED BY TRYPANOSOMA-EVANSI ON THE ISLAND OF MADURA, INDONESIA","During an outbreak of trapanosomiasis in cattle, buffalo and horses on the island of Madura, a survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi in the region. Blood samples were collected from 130 cattle and 147 buffalo in 5 villages, whole blood was examined for trypanosomes by the microhaematocrit (MHCT) method and serum samples were subjected to an enzyme linked immuno absorbent assay to detect T. evansi antibodies. T. evansi was detected by MHCT in 50% of the buffalo examined and 13% of the cattle, while antibodies were detected in 47% of the buffalo and 30% of the cattle. The outbreak was brought under control following the administration of Naganol(R) (Suramin, Bayer) to infected animals and animals considered to be at risk of infection."
Association between the prevalence of infestation by Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Ctenocephalides felis felis and the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies: A case-control study in dogs from a Brazilian endemic area,"The association between the prevalence of infestation by Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Ctenocephalides felis felis and the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies has been evaluated in dogs located in a city of Brazil endemic for canine visceral leishmaniasis. Blood samples from 5556 domestic dogs domiciliated in the urban area of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais state) were submitted to enzyme linked immunosorbent (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFAT) assays, and 432(7.8%) animals tested positive. Seropositive (n = 200) and seronegative (n = 200) dogs were randomly selected and examined for the presence of ticks and fleas, the results of which were expressed qualitatively as infested or non-infested, irrespective of the intensity of infestation. The prevalence of infestation by R. sanguineus was significantly greater (rho = 0.04) among seropositive dogs (38.5%) compared with their seronegative counterparts (29.0%). Similarly, the prevalence of infestation by C. felis felts was significantly greater (rho < 0.01) within the seropositive group (36.5%) than within the seronegative group (15.0%). Moreover, the probability of seropositivity for Leishmania was 53% higher in tick-infested dogs and 300% higher in flea-infested dogs in comparison with non-infested animals. Our data provide evidence of the vectorial capacity of these ectoparasites in transmitting Leishmania to the canine population, although further studies are needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.

Antibody response to Phlebotomus perniciosus saliva in cats naturally exposed to phlebotomine sand flies is positively associated with Leishmania infection,"Background: Zoonotic leishmaniosis, caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum, is a public and animal health problem in Asia, Central and South America, the Middle East and the Mediterranean Basin. Several phlebotomine sand fly species from the subgenus Larroussius are vectors of L. infantum. Data from dogs living in endemic areas of leishmaniosis advocate the use of antibody response to phlebotomine sand fly saliva as an epidemiological biomarker for monitoring vector exposure. The aim of this study was to analyse the exposure of cats to phlebotomine sand flies using detection of IgG antibodies to Phlebotomus perniciosus saliva. The association between phlebotomine sand fly exposure and the presence of Leishmania infection was also investigated. Results: IgG antibodies to P. perniciosus saliva were detected in 167 (47.7%) out of 350 cats; higher antibody levels were present in sera collected during the period of phlebotomine sand fly seasonal activity (OR= 19.44, 95% CI: 9.84-38.41). Cats of 12-35 months had higher antibody levels than younger ones (OR= 3.56, 95% CI: 1.39-9.16); this difference was also significant with older cats (for 36-95 months-old, OR= 9.43, 95% CI: 3.62-24.48; for older than 95 months, OR= 9.68, 95% CI: 3.92-23.91). Leishmania spp. DNA was detected in the blood of 24 (6.9%) cats, while antibodies to L. infantum were detected in three (0.9%). Only one cat was positive to Leishmania by both techniques. Cats presenting IgG antibodies to P. perniciosus had a significantly higher risk of being positive for Leishmania infection. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating anti-sand fly saliva antibodies in cats. The evaluation of the contact of this animal species with the vector is important to the development of prophylactic measures directed to cats, with the aim of reducing the prevalence of infection in an endemic area. Therefore, studies evaluating whether the use of imidacloprid/flumethrin collars reduces the frequency of P. perniciosus bites in cats are needed. It is also important to evaluate if there is a correlation between the number of phlebotomine sand fly bites and IgG antibody levels."
"Ecological aspects and molecular detection of Leishmania DNA Ross (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in terra firme and varzea environments in the Middle Solim(o)over-tildees Region, Amazonas State, Brazil","Background: Phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) are insects of medical importance due to the role that some species play in the transmission of leishmaniasis. This work aimed to study some ecological aspects among sand flies fauna inhabiting two different environments: the varzea (lowland Amazonian forest) and terra firme (upland Amazonian forest), both located in Tefe Municipality, Amazonas State, Braziland to detect Leishmania infection in those phlebotomine populations. Methods: Sand flies were collected using HP light traps. Collection took place over the course of six months: January, February, April, August, September, and October of 2013. To detect natural infection by Leishmania, DNA samples were extracted from female sand flies and submitted to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) targeting the kDNA gene; Leishmania species were identified by PCR-RFLP targeting the hsp70 gene and genetic sequencing. Results: In all, 5,716 individuals were collected, and 46 species were identified. Trichophoromyia ubiquitalis (3,330 - 58.26%) and Nyssomyia antunesi (661 - 11.26%) were the most abundant species. Species richness was greater in terra firme environments (42 species) than in the varzea environments (22 species), and forests ecotopes (43 species) were richer than peridomiciles (28 species). DNA of Leishmania was found in Trichophoromyia ubiquitalis and Psychodopygus davisi, both of which inhabit the terra firme environment and sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of Leishmania (Viannia) lainsoni DNA in Trichophoromyia ubiquitalis in Tefe Municipality. Conclusions: The high abundance of Trichophoromyia ubiquitalis and Ps. davisi and detection of DNA of Leishmania sp. may indicate that both species could be putative vectors for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) in the terra firme environment of Tefe. The sand fly fauna found in varzea is rich and diverse, exhibiting several species, nevertheless the seasonal hydric stress during part of the year that could influence the local diversity, if compared with other studies. This is the first report in Amazonas State of Trichophoromyia ubiquitalis with presence of Leishmania (Viannia) lainsoni DNA."
"Clinical and epidemiological aspects and diagnosis of Trypanosoma vivax infection in a cattle herd, state of Maranhao, Brazil","The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of trypanosomiasis in a dairy farm in municipality of Timon, State of Maranhao, Brazil. The owner reported abortus, births of weak calves, and mortality of adult animals with progressive weight loss. Visits to the property were carried out to obtain the history, realize animal examination and blood collection for the Woo test, hemograms, serological tests for trypanosomiasis, leptospirosis, and neosporosis and PCR for molecular diagnosis of Trypanosoma vivax. The identification of animals with low values in the hematocrit was the main hematological alteration identified in the herd. Two animals were positive in the Woo test and trypanosomes were visualized in blood smears, confirmed by molecular diagnosis as T. vivax. It was identified that 95.23% (40/42) of the animals with low hematocrit were serologically positive for T. vivax. The conditions identified in the property as an environment propitious to mechanical vectors, the presence of wild animals and the introduction of animals from states where trypanosomiasis outbreaks had already been reported were probably associated with the introduction and dissemination of the agent in the herd. The high number of serologically positive animals for trypanosomiasis 82.51% (151/183) shows that almost all the herd had contact with the agent. The rapid establishment of control measures, including the use of trypanocidal drugs, contributed to the control of the outbreak. The study allowed confirming the occurrence of another outbreak of trypanosomiasis in Brazil, The clinical diagnosis of the disease was difficult by the similarity of the clinical signs of trypanosomiasis with other diseases and the possibility of association of two or more diseases in the same patient, which emphasizes the importance of establishing adequate diagnostic measures as a way to avoid the dissemination of the disease and to minimize the economic losses of the producers."
"PREVALENCE OF AMERICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS AND LEISHMANIASES IN DOMESTIC DOGS IN A RURAL AREA OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF SAO JOAO DO PIAUI, PIAUI STATE, BRAZIL","Chagas disease and the leishmaniases are endemic zoonoses of great importance to public health in the state of Piaui, Brazil. The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is a major reservoir, host of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. in both urban and rural areas, playing an important role in the transmission of these parasites. The present study evaluated the prevalence of both infectious diseases in dogs of a rural area in the municipality of Sao Joao do Piaui, Piaui State. One hundred twenty-nine blood samples were collected for serological assessment: for the leishmaniases, 49 (38%) animals tested positive by the Dual-Path Platform technology (DPP), nine (6%) by the Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and 19 (14.7%) by the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody test (IFA); while for American Trypanosomiasis, 36 (28%) dogs were reagent by ELISA and 21 by IFA. Of the 129 dogs sampled, 76 were submitted to xenodiagnosis, bone marrow aspiration and skin biopsy to perform parasitological tests whose results showed only one (2.3%) positive skin sample for Trypanosoma caninum and one positive xenodiagnosis for T. cruzi, both results confirmed by molecular assays. Three hundred triatomines of the species Triatoma brasiliensis and 552 phlebotomines-509 (97%) of the species Lutzomyia longipalpis, were also captured."
Epidemiological survey on Leishmania infection in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and hunting dogs sharing the same rural area in Southern Italy,"Southern Italy, particularly Campania region, is an area where canine leishmaniasis (CanL) and zoonotic human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are endemic. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) has been hypothesized to play a role in occurrence of CanL in Italy but specific studies are poor. The aim of the present survey was to investigate the prevalence of Leishmania infection in dogs and foxes living in the same rural area (Picentini hills). 123 sera from autochthonous fox-hunting dogs were examined by immunofluorescent-antibody test (IFAT) using a cut-off of 1:160. The seroprevalence of dogs examined was 17.9%. Moreover, 48 foxes were examined after having been shooted by hunters or road accidents. Spleen, liver and lymph node samples were analyzed by specific Leishmania nested PCR (n-PCR). 10 foxes were found infected by L. infantum (20.8%) of which 4 animals in spleen, 2 in lymph nodes and 4 both in spleen and lymph nodes. The overall n-PCR positivity was 17.4% for spleen samples and 13.3% for lymph nodes; all liver samples resulted negative. In positive PCR foxes no signs clearly referable to leishmaniasis were recorded at necropsy. The results confirmed the presence of L. infantum infection in red foxes from Southern Italy, with a moderate level of exposure. Because large proportions of dogs with ascertained progressive leishmaniasis show a prolonged ""subpatent condition"" during which they are only positive to n-PCR before seroconversion, our results allow to assume that exposure risk in foxes is lower than hunting dogs living in the studied area."
THE SKUNK CONEPATUS-CHINGA AS NEW HOST OF TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI IN ARGENTINA,"We report the first systematic epidemiological research carried out in Argentina on the skunk Conepatus chinga. Forty-nine animals were captured in the settlements of Amama, Trinidad, and nearby forested areas located in the Department of Moreno, Province of Santiago del Estero, between April 1985 and May 1989. Isolation of parasites was done through xenodiagnosis, and their identification as Trypanosoma cruzi was achieved by biological and biochemical criteria. The isolate was highly virulent and pathogenic in inoculated C3H mice. Prevalence was 4.1% (2 of 49). Two facts account for a possible domestic source of infection: both infected skunks were captured near Trinidad, in an area that had never been treated with insecticides, and electrophoretic isoenzyme patterns of the parasites isolated from the skunks were identical to those found in humans. Because extensive deforestation probably would increase the distribution area of C. chinga, further investigation should be performed to evaluate the epidemiological role of this wild mammal."
"Prevalence of trypanosome infections in dogs from Chagas disease endemic regions in Panama, Central America","The prevalence of canine trypanosomosis was investigated in two Chagas disease endemic rural communities located in the central region of Panama. Serologic tests for Trypanosoma cruzi infection revealed a prevalence of 11.1%. Hemocultures coupled with PCR analysis demonstrated a Trypanosoma rangeli infection rate of 5.1%. An overall trypanosome infection index of 16.2% (16/99) was detected in this canine population. One dog had a mixed infection of T. cruzi and T. rangeli. Six of the trypanosome-infected dogs belong to people who were diagnosed of Chagas disease. We conclude that dogs from this rural area of Panama are frequently infected with trypanosomes transmitted by the sylvatic vector, Rhodnius pallescens, and suggest that dogs are important in the peridomestic transmission cycle of trypanosomes as reservoirs and hosts. The epidemiological implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Infection by trypanosomes in marsupials and rodents associated with human dwellings in Ecuador,"Small mammals trapped in domestic and peridomestic environments of rural Ecuador were screened for trypanosome infection by direct microscopy and hemoculture. Identification of species of trypanosomes was then performed by morphological characteristics and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Of 194 animals collected, 15 were positive for infection (7.73%). Eight (4.12%) were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (1 of 33 Didelphis marsupialis; 7 of 61 Rattus rattus). Eleven R. rattus (18.03%) harbored T. lewisi, 5 of which presented mixed infections with T. cruzi. Additionally, 1 of 3 Orvzomys xanthaeolits was infected with T. rangeli. No trypanosome infection was detected in Philander opossum (n=1), Mus musculus (n=79), Rattus norvegicus (n=8), Akodon orophilus (n=4), Sigmodon peruanus (n=3), or Proechimys decumanus (n=2). Many of the isolates belong to T cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, and R. rattus had the highest prevalence. Because of its abundance in the study areas, this species is considered an important reservoir for Chagas disease. This is the first report of T. lewisi and T. rangeli in Ecuador. This study is also the first to describe natural mixed infections of T. cruzi-T. lewisi."
"Bats, Trypanosomes, and Triatomines in Ecuador: New Insights into the Diversity, Transmission, and Origins of Trypanosoma cruzi and Chagas Disease","The generalist parasite Trypanosoma cruzi has two phylogenetic lineages associated almost exclusively with bats-Trypanosoma cruzi Tcbat and the subspecies T. c. marinkellei. We present new information on the genetic variation, geographic distribution, host associations, and potential vectors of these lineages. We conducted field surveys of bats and triatomines in southern Ecuador, a country endemic for Chagas disease, and screened for trypanosomes by microscopy and PCR. We identified parasites at species and genotype levels through phylogenetic approaches based on 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) and cytochrome b (cytb) genes and conducted a comparison of nucleotide diversity of the cytb gene. We document for the first time T. cruzi Tcbat and T. c. marinkellei in Ecuador, expanding their distribution in South America to the western side of the Andes. In addition, we found the triatomines Cavernicola pilosa and Triatoma dispar sharing shelters with bats. The comparisons of nucleotide diversity revealed a higher diversity for T. c. marinkellei than any of the T. c. cruzi genotypes associated with Chagas disease. Findings from this study increased both the number of host species and known geographical ranges of both parasites and suggest potential vectors for these two trypanosomes associated with bats in rural areas of southern Ecuador. The higher nucleotide diversity of T. c. marinkellei supports a long evolutionary relationship between T. cruzi and bats, implying that bats are the original hosts of this important parasite."
Long-term prevalence of the protists Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi and detection of the microsporidium Nosema bombi in invasive bumble bees,"An initial survey in 2009 carried out at a site in northwestern Patagonia region, Argentina, revealed for the first time in South America the presence of the flagellate Crithidia bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi, two pathogens associated with the Palaearctic invasive bumble bee Bombus terrestris. In order to determine the long-term persistence and dynamics of this microparasite complex, four additional collections at the same site (San Carlos de Bariloche) were conducted along the following seven years. Both protists were detected in all collections: prevalence was 2%-21.6% for C. bombi and 1.2%-14% for A. bombi. In addition, the microsporidium Nosema bombi was recorded for the first time in the country in the last two collections, at prevalences of 12.4% and 2.4% and unusually high infection intensities (Average=6.56 x 10(7) spores per individual). Due to the exceptional dispersal ability of the exotic B. terrestris, these three multihost pathogens should be considered as potential threats to South American native bumble bees."
Invasive Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae) parasitized by a flagellate (Euglenozoa: Kinetoplastea) and a neogregarine (Apicomplexa: Neogregarinorida),"The flagellate Crithidia bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi have been found in individuals of Bombus terrestris, a Palaearctic species of humble bee commercially reared and shipped worldwide for pollination services. B. terrestris has recently entered into the northwestern Patagonia region of Argentina from Chile. where it was introduced in 1998. Prevalence was 21.6% for C bombi and 3.6% for A. bombi (n = 111). The pathogens were not detected in 441 humble bees belonging to five of the eight known Argentine native species (Bombus atratus, Bombus morio, Bombus bellicosus, Bombus opifex, Bombus tucumanus) collected elsewhere in the Country. Although the absence of natural occurrence of C bombi and A. bombi in Argentine native humble bees cannot be ascertained at present due to the limited surveys performed, it is important to report their detection in invasive B. terrestris. The invasion event is relatively recent and the accompanying pathogens are not species specific within the genus Bombus. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

"Seasonal variability of prevalence and occurrence of multiple infections shape the population structure of Crithidia bombi, an intestinal parasite of bumblebees (Bombus spp.)","Ergonomic growth phases of annual social insect societies strongly influence horizontally transmitted parasites. Herein, we focused on the impact of temporal changes in host demography on the population structure of a horizontally transmitted parasite. Seasonal fluctuations in prevalence and the occurrence of multiple infections of the gut parasite Crithidia bombi were analyzed in repeatedly sampled populations of two common bumblebee (Bombus spp.) species. Prevalence of C. bombi was greatest in the middle of the foraging season and coincided with the maximal occurrence of multiple infections. Both decline later in the season. The genetic structure of the parasite population also showed strong seasonal fluctuations with a drastic decline in effective population size and an increase in linkage disequilibrium when infection rates were highest. These effects are mainly attributable to significant changes in parasite allele frequencies leading to selection of specific alleles and increasing the frequency of homozygote genotypes in the middle of the season. Within host, competition between parasite genotypes might explain the observed pattern leading to selection of these alleles, and thus a boost of homozygote genotypes in the middle of the season. Toward the end of the season, selection appears to relax and we observed a recovery in linkage equilibrium, as well as an increase in effective population size. This might be explained by genetic exchange in these trypanosomes in natural populations."
PROTOZOA IN POISON DART FROGS (DENDROBATIDAE) - CLINICAL-ASSESSMENT AND IDENTIFICATION,"Poison dart frogs (Dendrobatidae) are small, brightly colored frogs indigenous to the neotropics. In the wild, two genera are vulnerable to extinction, yet in captivity increasing numbers of dendrobatids are maintained. Despite the great interest in these frogs, there is little published information available on their health. Clinical assessment of the protozoa from wild-caught and captive-bred dendrobatids was based on examination of approximately 300 direct fecal samples from a colony of frogs. Intestinal protozoa were observed in 26% of all colony frogs. In different groups, the prevalences were as follows: sick frogs, 50%; quarantined frogs, 35%; healthy frogs, 25%; and exiting frogs, 15%. The densities of infection were usually light or moderate for all protozoa (opalinid, ciliate, and flagellate trophozoites and opalinid and coccidian cysts). Most of the intestinal protozoa appeared to be commensals rather than parasites and are not routinely treated. The use of therapeutic agents may be indicated, however, to regain homeostasis in frogs following stressful events such as capture, shipping, or illness. Protozoa were identified in detail from black and green poison dart frogs (Dendrobates auratus) and strawberry poison dart frogs (Dendrobates pumilio), ''research frogs'' wild caught in Central America especially for this purpose. The 69 research frogs were euthanized and necropsied. Protozoans in the large intestine and blood were photographed and preserved for identification using light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. All research frogs had a dense protozoan fauna in their large intestine. Organisms included the opalinid Zelleriella sp., the ciliate Nyctotheroides sp., and retortamonad, trichomonad, and diplomonad flagellates; these flagellates are reported from dendrobatids for the first time. Prevalence of infection was not significantly different in D. auratus euthanized within a day of capture and in frogs subsequently maintained in captivity. Nyctotheroides sp. was not seen in D. pumilio, and Zelleriella sp. was significantly less prevalent in D. pumilio than in D. auratus. Trypanosoma sp. was present in the blood of D. auratus."
Results of a monitoring program of pesticide residues in Beebread in Spain. Using Toxic unit approach to identify scenarios of risk for management programs,"In this work we present the results of a monitoring program of apiaries conducted in spring 2014 in Spain The aim of the study was to identify the main pathogens and residues in beebread as chronic exposure source to managed honey bees. Beebread and worker bee and samples from 71 and 51 apiaries, respectively were obtained. Beebread from the brood chamber combs were extracted aseptically from each honey bee colony as described previously) -3 Samples were stored at -80 C until further use. All honey bee worker samples were analyzed for the main pathogens related to the weakening and death of bee colonies in Spain. PCR was performed for Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae Trypanosomatids, Neogregarines, Lake Sinai Virus complex (LSV complex), and Acute Bee Paralysis Virus-Kashmir Bee Virus-Israeli Acute Paralisis Virus complex (AKI complex) Specific primers and probes for the amplification of Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV) and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) were used. A Screening analysis of chemical residues was conducted with a modified QuEChERS protocol and under ISO 17025 standard and guidance document SANCO/12571/2013 The most prevalent pathogens were Nosema ceranae (69%), Varroa destructor mite (49%), with a mean percentage of parasitization around 1.7%, and Trypanosomatids (40.7%). Neogregarines (6%), Acarapis woodi (7%) and Nosema apis (7%) were detected a lower prevalence. Of the six screening viruses, the more prevalent were BQCV (57%) and DWV (54%). LSV complex was detected in the 14% of the samples. The pesticides most commonly found in the samples were miticides typically used for Varroa mite control: coumaphos (98.6%), chlorfenvinphos (72.86%); tau-fluvalinate (70%) and secondly, carbendazim (40%) chlorpyriphos (45.71%), acrinathrin (24.9%) and imidacloprid (22.6%) were also detected. Based on these results, we discuss the suitability of different methodologies proposed in the literature to assess the effect of honey bees chronically exposed to multiple residue and nosogenic agents found in hive."
Large-scale cultivation of the bumblebee gut microbiota reveals an underestimated bacterial species diversity capable of pathogen inhibition,"A total of 1940 isolates from gut samples of 60 bumblebees representing Bombus pascuorum, Bombus terrestris, Bombus lucorum and Bombus lapidarius was collected and identified through state-of the-art taxonomic methods. The bacterial species diversity in these Bombus species exceeded that suggested by phylotype analysis through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and revealed that B. pascuorum and B. terrestris had a unique microbiota composition, each. Representatives of most phylotypes reported earlier and detected in the present study were effectively isolated, and included several novel bacterial taxa and species reported for the first time in the bumblebee gut. Isolates were screened in pectin degradation assays and growth inhibition assays against the honeybee pathogens Paenibacillus larvae, Melissococcus plutonius and Ascosphaera apis and the bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi. While inhibitory activity against each of these pathogens was observed, only one single culture was able to degrade pectin and polygalacturonic acid in vitro. The availability of accurately identified microbial isolates will facilitate future evaluation of the functional potential of the bumblebee gut microbiota."
Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of Trypanosoma spp. detected from striped leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros vittatus) in Zambia,"Bat trypanosomes consist of more than 30 trypanosome species from over 70 species of bats. Recent studies suggest that bats play a role in disseminating trypanosomes from African continent to the terrestrial mammals both in the Afrotropic-Palearctic Ecozones and Nearctic Ecozone. However, the diversity, distribution, and evolution of bat trypanosomes are still unclear. To better understand their evolution, more genetic data of bat trypanosomes from a variety of locations are required. During a survey of Borrelia spp. of bats inhabiting a cave in Zambia, we observed flagellate parasites from 5 of 43 hemocultures. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gGAPDH; 572 bp) and the 18S ribosomal RNA gene (18S rRNA gene; 1,079-1,091 bp) revealed that all were Trypanosoma spp. belonged to the Trypanosoma cruzi Glade. Three and two of them exhibited the similarity with T. conorhini and T. dionisii, respectively. The present study provides the first genetic data on Trypanosoma spp. of bats inhabiting Zambia."
Leishmania spp. in Didelphis albiventris and Micoureus paraguayanus (Didelphimorphia: Didelphidae) of Brazil,"Leishmaniasis is kept in nature by the participation of several animal species. This study evaluated the presence of Leishmania spp. in skin samples of free-ranging marsupials Micoureus paraguayanus (n = 95) and Didelphis albiventris (n = 191), captured in Morro do Diabo State Park and in sections of its surrounding forest, in the region of Pontal do Paranapanema, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The samples were tested for the presence of kDNA of Leishmania spp. by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by real time PCR (qPCR). All samples from D. albiventris tested by PCR were negative for the presence of kDNA of Leishmania spp. However, when tested by qPCR, the positivity was 1.6%. A positivity of 7.4% by PCR and 11.6% by qPCR was observed for M. paraguayanus. Sixty-four per cent (9/14) of positive animals were limited to the same forest fragment. Presence of Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis and Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis was detected in M. paraguayanus samples. While D. albiventris is the most studied marsupial species due to its urban habits, other marsupial species such as M. paraguayanus can be potential reservoirs of Leishmania spp. and should also be studied.

Canine leishmaniasis in the Rif mountains (Moroccan Mediterranean coast): Sero-epidemiological survey,"A sero-epidemiological survey has been conducted in several localities of the province of Nador to investigate canine leishmaniasis in the North-Eastern slope of the Rif mountains (Mediterranean coast of Morocco). Serum samples collected from 257 dogs were analysed using indirect fluorescent antibody test (lFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies. Forty eight (18.7 %) of the screened dogs were IFAT positive and 54 (21.0 %) were ELISA positive; the concordance of the two methods was 96.1 %. The prevalence of infection is significantly higher in dogs more than four years of age whereas no significant difference in prevalence of infection was seen between males and females. The frequent symptoms observed in seropositive dogs were the enlargement of lymph nodes (57.4 %), emaciation (51.9 %) and skin involvement (25.9 %). However, 38.9 % of those dogs showed no ore of the major symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmania isolated from three of the examined dogs was identified as L. infantum MON-1. These results show that the North-Eastern slope of the Rif mountains is one of the most active Mediterranean areas of visceral leishmaniasis and confirm that the dog is the main reservoir of L. infantum."
High prevalence of Trypanosoma rangeli and Trypanosoma cruzi in opossums and triatomids in a formerly-endemic area of Chagas disease in Southeast Brazil,"In Brazil Trypanosoma rangeli has been detected in humans, sylvatic mammals and vectors in the Amazon Basin and in wild rodents in a Southern State. Here we report for the first time a high prevalence of T rangeli in opossums and triatomids captured in peridomestic environments in a formerly-endemic area of Chagas disease in Southeast Brazil. Five molecular typing tools clearly indicate the presence of T rangeli and Trypanosoma cruzi in mammalian reservoirs and triatomids. Twenty-one opossums (Didelphis albiventris) were captured and flagellates were detected in the blood of 57.1% (12/21) of the animals. Single infections with T rangeli or T cruzi were diagnosed, respectively, in 58.4 and 8.3% of the opossums. Mixed infections were observed in 33.3%. Forty-four triatomids (38 Rhodnius neglectus and 6 Panstrongylus megistus) were collected in palm trees within 50 in from human dwellings. Flagellates were observed in the digestive tract and feces of 50% of the insects. PCR assays performed in DNA samples obtained from 16 cultures of the intestinal tract revealed single infection with T cruzi (68.7%) or T rangeli (6.3%), as well as mixed infections (25%). T rangeli was also detected in the hemolymph of two specimens. Genotyping revealed predominance of T cruzi I. The data suggest that R. neglectus in conjunction with D. albiventris may be significant factors in the maintenance of the sylvatic and peridomestic cycles of T rangeli in the region. The finding of T cruzi and T rangeli in triatomine species capable of domiciliation and therefore considered as alternative vectors for the parasite transmission opens up the possibility of re-establishment of Chagas disease following reinfestation of houses.

Ecological Connectivity of Trypanosoma cruzi Reservoirs and Triatoma pallidipennis Hosts in an Anthropogenic Landscape with Endemic Chagas Disease,"Traditional methods for Chagas disease prevention are targeted at domestic vector reduction, as well as control of transfusion and maternal-fetal transmission. Population connectivity of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected vectors and hosts, among sylvatic, ecotone and domestic habitats could jeopardize targeted efforts to reduce human exposure. This connectivity was evaluated in a Mexican community with reports of high vector infestation, human infection, and Chagas disease, surrounded by agricultural and natural areas. We surveyed bats, rodents, and triatomines in dry and rainy seasons in three adjacent habitats (domestic, ecotone, sylvatic), and measured T. cruzi prevalence, and host feeding sources of triatomines. Of 12 bat and 7 rodent species, no bat tested positive for T. cruzi, but all rodent species tested positive in at least one season or habitat. Highest T. cruzi infection prevalence was found in the rodents, Baiomys musculus and Neotoma mexicana. In general, parasite prevalence was not related to habitat or season, although the sylvatic habitat had higher infection prevalence than by chance, during the dry season. Wild and domestic mammals were identified as bloodmeals of T. pallidipennis, with 9% of individuals having mixed human (4.8% single human) and other mammal species in bloodmeals, especially in the dry season; these vectors tested >50% positive for T. cruzi. Overall, ecological connectivity is broad across this matrix, based on high rodent community similarity, vector and T. cruzi presence. Cost-effective T. cruzi, vector control strategies and Chagas disease transmission prevention will need to consider continuous potential for parasite movement over the entire landscape. This study provides clear evidence that these strategies will need to include reservoir/host species in at least ecotones, in addition to domestic habitats."

The Seminested PCR Based Detection of Leishmania infantum Infection in Asymptomatic Dogs in a New Endemic Focus of Visceral Leishmaniasis in Iran,"Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala-azar) is a serious health problem in some northern and south western parts of Iran. The incidence of kala-azar caused by Leishmania infantum has recently increased in Nourabad-Mamassani district of Fars Province, in the south of the country. This study was designed to determine the role of asymptomatic dogs as host reservoir of L. infantum in this new formed focus and detection of prevalence of infection near them. A total of 20 asymptomatic stray and sheep dogs were randomly sampled. The Buffy coat layer of their peripheral blood was used for DNA extraction and PCR. A species specific seminested PCR was used for DNA amplification using LINR4, LIN17 and LIN19 primers. These primers amplified variable area of the minicircle kDNA of Leishmania parasites. Of the 20 sampled dogs checked for leishmanial kDNA, six (30%) were found naturally infected. It is concluded that, dogs (Canis familiaris) even if asymptomatic, is considered as the domestic host reservoir of kala-azar in this endemic focus."
A study on African animal trypanosomosis in four areas of Senegal,"In Senegal, several areas provide great potential for agriculture and animal production, but African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) is one of the major constraints to the development of more effective livestock production systems. A study was conducted to assess the current situation of AAT in this country. Surveys were carried out between June 2011 and September 2012 in four different areas: Dakar, Sine Saloum, Kedougou region and Basse Casamance in several animal species: dogs (152), donkeys (23), horses (63), sheep (43), goats (52) and cattle (104), distributed in the four sites. Molecular tools (PCR) indicated 3.4% positive animals including dogs, donkeys, a goat and cattle. The savannah type of Trypanosoma congolense Broden, 1904 (53% of positive cases) and the forest type of T. congolense (subgenus Nannomonas Hoare, 1964) were predominant. Trypanosoma vivax Ziemann, 1905 (subgenus Duttonella Chalmers, 1918) was only present in one animal and no trypanosome of the subgenus Trypanozoon Luhe, 1906 was found. Half of the positive cases were detected in Sine Saloum, where T. congolense savannah-type was predominant, and the other half in Basse Casamance, where T. congolense forest-type was predominant; no cases were found in Dakar or in the Kedougou region. A high risk of infection in dogs with T. congolense savannah-type was shown in Sine Saloum, requiring prevention and control of dogs in this area. The involvement of tsetse flies in the transmission of T. congolense in Sine Saloum and Basse Casamance is discussed."
Differential diagnosis of the honey bee trypanosomatids Crithidia mellificae and Lotmaria passim,"Trypanosomatids infecting honey bees have been poorly studied with molecular methods until recently. After the description of Crithidia mellificae (Langridge and McGhee, 1967) it took about forty years until molecular data for honey bee trypanosomatids became available and were used to identify and describe a new trypanosomatid species from honey bees, Lotmaria passim (Evans and Schwarz, 2014). However, an easy method to distinguish them without sequencing is not yet available. Research on the related bumble bee parasites Crithidia bombi and Crithidia expoeki revealed a fragment length polymorphism in the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), which enabled species discrimination. In search of fragment length polymorphisms for differential diagnostics in honey bee trypanosomatids, we studied honey bee trypanosomatid cell cultures of C mellificae and L passim. This research resulted in the identification of fragment length polymorphisms in ITS1 and ITS1-2 markers, which enabled us to develop a diagnostic method to differentiate both honey bee trypanosomatid species without the need for sequencing. However, the amplification success of the ITS1 marker depends probably on the trypanosomatid infection level. Further investigation confirmed that L passim is the dominant species in Belgium, Japan and Switzerland. We found C mellificae only rarely in Belgian honey bee samples, but not in honey bee samples from other countries. C mellificae was also detected in mason bees (Osmia bicornis and Osmia cornuta) besides in honey bees. Further, the characterization and comparison of additional markers from L passim strain SF (published as C mellificae strain SF) and a Belgian honey bee sample revealed very low divergence in the 18S rRNA, ITS1-2, 28S rRNA and cytochrome b sequences. Nevertheless, a variable stretch was observed in the gp63 virulence factor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Prevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis in dogs at Adrestan district detected by PCR,
Blood Parasites of Frogs From an Equatorial African Montane Forest in Western Uganda,"In a survey of blood parasites in Ugandan frogs, 30(17%) of 180 frogs were infected with at least 1 species of Hepatozoon or Trypanosoma, or with microfilariae. There were significant differences in the prevalence of parasitism among species, with parasitemia detected in only 3 of 9 species. The intensity of blood parasite infection ranged from 1 to 1,080 infected cells per 5,000 cells examined. Seasonal changes in the prevalence and intensity of parasitemia were not observed, nor was there any association between parasitemia and infection with the pandemic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis."
Surveys in Papua New Guinea to detect the presence of Trypanosoma evansi infection,"Objective To confirm serological evidence that Trypanosoma evansi is present in Papua New Guinea. Design Three surveys were undertaken in PNG during 1997/1998. Animals were selected for sampling on the basis of convenience. Samples of blood were examined for the presence of T evansi by the haematocrit centrifugation technique (HCT) and mouse inoculation test (MI). Sera were tested in the field using the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis/T evansi (CATT). Bovine sera were tested at James Cook University using an antibody-detection ELISA (Ab-ELISA). Results from testing bovine sera with the Ab-ELISA and sera from wallabies with the CATT were analysed using FreeCalc to determine the probability that animals in these populations were infected with T evansi. Results A total of 545 serum samples were collected. during the three surveys of which 39 cattle, two pig and three agile wallaby samples were positive with the CATT. All bovine sera collected were negative when tested with an Ab-ELISA. T evansi was not isolated using the HCT or the MI from any of these animals. Conclusion Based on the Ab-ELISA results it was concluded that T evansi infection was not present in cattle in villages around Balimo at a minimum expected prevalence of 10% (P < 0.05) and, based on the CATT results, that infection was not present in wallabies on the Bula plain at a minimum expected prevalence of 10% (P < 0.1). These results indicate that it is unlikely that T evansi is endemic in PNG."
Evaluation of PCR as a diagnostic mass-screening tool to detect Leishmania (Viannia) spp. in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris),"Several studies have suggested that the PCR could be used in epidemiological mass-screening surveys to detect Leishmania (Piannia) spp. infection in human and animal hosts. Dogs from an area of Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania peruviana endemicity were screened for American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) infection by established PCR-based and enzyme-linked immunosorbent antibody test (ELISA) protocols. PCR detected Leishmania (Viannia) infection in a total of 90 of 1,066 (8.4%) dogs: 32 of 368 (8.7%), 65 of 769 (8.5%), and 7 of 42 (16.7%) dogs were PCR positive by testing of whole blood, bully coat, and bone marrow aspirates, respectively. ELISA detected infection in 221 of 1,059 (20.9%) tested dogs. The high prevalence of Leishmania (Viannia) detected by PCR and ELISA in both asymptomatic (7.5 and 19.2%, respectively) and symptomatic (32 and 62.5%, respectively) dogs is further circumstantial evidence for their suspected role as reservoir hosts of ACL. However, the low sensitivity of PCR (31%) compared to ELISA (81%) indicates that PCR cannot be used for mass screening of samples in ACL epidemiological studies. Unless more-sensitive PCR protocols were to be developed, its use should be restricted to the diagnosis of active (canine and human) cases and to the parasitological monitoring of patients after chemotherapy."
Use of PCR to detect Leishmania (Viannia) spp. in dog blood and bone marrow,"A PCR-based protocol for the detection of Leishmania (Viannia) parasites in canine blood, buffy coat, and bone marrow was developed and was then tested with held samples taken from a random sample of 545 dogs from villages in Peru where Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana are endemic. Comparative tests with cultured parasites mixed with dog bleed shelved that the PCR assay's sensitivity was significantly dependent on the DNA extraction protocol and the PCR primers used. Mass screening of: field samples by the preferred PCR protocol detected American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in IJ of 545 (8.1%) dogs; 31 of 402 (7.7%), 20 of 223 (9.0%), and 8 of 46 (17.4%) were PCR positive when whole blood, buffy coat, and bone marrow aspirates, respectively, were tested. The high prevalence of Leishmania in both asymptomatic (7.6%) and symptomatic (18.0%) dogs provides further circumstantial evidence for their suspected role as reservoir hosts of ACL and indicates that hematogenous dissemination of parasites may be a more common pathological phenomenon than has previously been acknowledged. However, unlike for zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis, the comparatively low prevalence of Leishmania (Viannia) in the blood of symptomatic dogs indicates that PCR with blood cannot be the ""gold standard"" for the (mass) screening of samples in epidemiological studies."

"Trypanosoma cruzi strains from triatomine collected in Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","OBJECTIVE: Collection of triatomines in domestic, peridomestic and sylvatic environments in states of Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul, Northeastern and Southern Brazil respectively, and isolation of Trypanosoma cruzi strains. METHODS: First, the captured triatomines were identified using insect identification keys, then their intestinal content was examined by abdominal compression, and the samples containing trypanosomatid forms were inoculated in LIT medium and Swiss mice. RESULTS: Six triatomine species were collected in cities in Bahia, namely Panstrongylus geniculatus (01), Triatoma melanocephala (11), T. lenti (94), T. pseudomaculata (02), T. sherlocki (26) and T. sordida (460), and two in cities in Rio Grande do Sul, namely T. circummaculata (11) and T. rubrovaria (115). Out of the specimens examined, T. cruzi was isolated from 28 triatomine divided into four different species: T. melanocephala (one), T. lenti (one), T. rubrovaria (16) and T. sordida (10). Their index of natural infection by T. cruzi was 6.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of T. cruzi strains from triatomines found in domestic and peridomestic areas shows the potential risk of transmission of Chagas disease in the studied cities. The maintenance of those T. cruzi strains in laboratory is intended to promote studies that facilitate the understanding of the parasite-vector-host relationship."
Molecular Method Confirms Canine Leishmania Infection Detected by Serological Methods in Non-Endemic Area of Brazil,"In Brazil, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is expanding and becoming urbanized, especially in non-endemic areas such as the State of Rio Grande do Sul. Considering that infected dogs are the main reservoir for zoonotic VL, this study evaluated the prevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre, a new area of expansion of VL in Brazil. Serum and plasma from 405 asymptomatic dogs from the municipalities of Canoas (n=107), Sao Leopoldo (n=216), and Novo Hamburgo (n=82) were tested for CVL using immunochromatographic (DPP (R)) and ELISA EIE (R) assays (2 assays officially adopted by the Brazilian government for the diagnosis of CVL) and real-time PCR to confirm the results. There was no agreement among serological and real-time PCR results, indicating that the Leishmania infection in asymptomatic animals with low parasite load, confirmed by negative parasitological tests (smears and parasite culture), need to be evaluated by molecular methods. The prevalence of LVC in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, confirmed by real-time PCR was 4% (5.6% in Canoas and 4.6% in Sao Leopoldo). The use of molecular method is essential for accurate diagnosis of CVL, especially in asymptomatic dogs in non-endemic areas."
"Correlation between populations of Rhodnius and presence of palm trees as risk factors for the emergence of Chagas disease in Amazon region, Brazil","Among the states that comprise the legally defined Amazon region of Brazil, Para has presented the highest occurrences of acute cases of Chagas disease over the last two decades. These cases have been attributed to consumption of fruits from native palm trees. In surveys in rural and wild areas of the municipality of Oriximina, Para, triatomine fauna, their main ecotopes and the infection rate due to Trypanosoma cruzi were identified using active and passive search methods: manual capture and Noireau traps, respectively. A total of 582 ecotopes were surveyed using 1496 Noireau traps. Out of 442 specimens collected, 289 were identified as Rhodnius robustus and 153 as Rhodnius pictipes. The infection rate caused by T. cruzi was 17.4%. The food sources of the triatomines were found to be birds, hemolymph, horses, and rodents. The association between R. robustus and inaja palm trees (Attalea marita), which are abundant in rural areas, was confirmed. On the other hand, R. pictipes is found in several palm tree species, such as maid (A. marita), mucaja (Acrocomia aculeata), murumuru (Astrocaryum murumuru) and pataua (Oenocarpus bataua), and in bromeliads in wild areas. These occurrences of triatomine species in regions with or without T. cruzi infection, in the vicinity of the main settlement of the municipality, suggest that there is a need for entomological and epidemiological surveillance in this region.

"Diagnosis and epidemiology of Leishmania infantum in domestic cats in an endemic area of the Amazon region, Brazil","Visceral leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leishmania infantum for which dogs are the main reservoir. In South America, presence of this disease is expanding along with increasing dispersion of its principal vector, the sand-fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. Feline leishmaniasis is an emerging disease in domestic cats, but epidemiological studies in endemic areas of the Amazon region of Brazil are scarce and the role of cats as reservoirs of L. infantum has been debated. The aim of this study was to investigate L. infantum infection in cats living in the Amazon biome region, using serological and molecular methods. A total of 105 cats were subjected to clinical examination and blood samples were taken for immunofluorescent-antibody (1FAT) serological evaluation, to determine anti-Leishmania antibody titers. Conventional PCR and Sanger's sequencing targeting L. infantum chitinase and Leishmania species ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) encoding genes were performed on conjunctival swabs from these cats. Seropositivity was detected in 32 animals (30.48%), thus confirming that contact between these cats and the parasite was occurring. PCR followed by amplicon sequencing showed that three samples (2.86%) were positive for a chitinase gene and six (5.71%) were positive for the ITS-1 gene. Parasite-positive diagnoses presented a statistically significant association with free access to the streets (p = 0.0111), cohabitation with dogs affected previously by VL (p = 0.0006) and absence of backyard cleaning and garbage collection (p = 0.00003). These results emphasize that cats should be included in epidemiological surveys of leishmaniasis, especially in endemic areas, if not as the reservoir host (unproven), at least as a ""sentinel host"" that is useful for revealing situations of endemic circulation of L. infantum. Moreover, in these areas, feline leishmaniasis needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis among domestic cats presenting alopecia, rarefied hair, lacerations and ulcerative dermatitis."
"Epidemiological aspects of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis in State of Alagoas, Northeast, Brazil","Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL), caused by protozoans of the genus Leishmania, it is a worldwide of great importance disease. In the northeast region of Brazil, the state of Alagoas has an endemic status for ZVL. Thus, this work aimed to analyze the epidemiological situation of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis in Alagoas, Northeast, Brazil, from 2007 to 2013. We conducted a descriptive, observational, retrospective study using secondary data from the Notifiable Diseases Information System, the Center of Zoonosis Control of Maceio, and the Central Laboratory of Public Health of Alagoas. During the studied period, it was observed that the highest incidence of human visceral leishmaniasis was in 2011 and the lowest in 2013. On the other hand, canine visceral leishmaniasis had its highest incidence in 2007 and its lowest in 2012. Of the 55 municipalities in the State of Alagoas that showed human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL), Sao Jose da Tapera presented an average of 4.4 cases over the past five years, being classified as of intense transmission. Regarding canine visceral leishmaniasis, in the same studied period, 45,112 dogs were examined in the State, of which 4,466 were positive. It resulted, thus, in a 9.9% positivity rate. Conclusions: Our data are important because canine infection is an important risk factor for the human disease."
Epidemiological survey of Lutzomyia longipalpis infected by Leishmania infantum in an endemic area of Brazil,"The objective of this study was to perform an epidemiological survey to determine the areas at risk of visceral leishmaniasis through the detection and quantification of natural infection by Leishmania infantum in Lutzomyia longipalpis. The sandflies were captured between February 2009 and January 2010, at 21 sites in four regions of the Fortaleza municipality. Samples were screened for the presence of Leishmania DNA by Real Time PCR (qPCR), amplification of kDNA minicircle sequence. Out of the 123 pools of analyzed sandflies, 45 were positive for L. infantum, and the minimum infection rate was 3.7%. In the north, south, east and west regions, the pool screen assay predicted sand- fly infection prevalence of 3.4%, 4.7%, 4.9% and 8.4%, respectively. The parasite load ranged from 2.45 +/- 0.96 to 2,820,246 +/- 106,072. No statistical differences were found with respect to the frequency of sand-fly infection between the regions (P= 0.3014), seasons (P = 0.3906) or trap locations (P = 0.8486). Statistical differences were found with respect to the frequency of sand-fly infection between the two seasons only in the west region (P= 0.0152). The qPCR was able to detect and quantify L. infantum in L. longipalpis, therefore succeeding in identifying the areas of greatest risk of VL transmission."
Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania spp. in domestic donkeys from Portugal,"Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania infantum are zoonotic protozoal parasites. Serum samples were obtained from 186 donkeys (Equus africanus asinus) from Portugal and assessed for antibodies to T. gondii by the modified agglutination test (MAT). For titration of antibodies to Leishmania spp. the direct agglutination test was used (DAT). Eleven donkeys were seropositive for T. gondii with titres of 20 (n = 7), 80 (n = 2), 640 (n = 1) and >= 2560 (n = 1). One donkey was seropositive for Leishmania spp. (titre of 800). Donkeys in Portugal are exposed to and can be infected with T. gondii and Leishmania spp."

Cross-sectional study on prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection in domestic ruminants in an endemic area of the Canary Islands (Spain),"Trypanosoma evansi is the most widely spread of the pathogenic African trypanosomes of animals. The disease (surra) was first diagnosed in the Canary Islands in a dromedary camel in 1997; thus, a control plan was implemented achieving the eventual eradication of T. evansi from most of the infected areas in the Archipelago. However, a little area remains still infected despite the use of the same control measures. To evaluate possible reservoirs in the area a representative sample of domestic ruminants was examined by serological, parasitological and molecular tests. Of a total of 1228 ruminants assessed, 61 (5%) were serologically positive (7 cattle, 21 goats, 33 sheep), but T. evansi could be demonstrated in none of them. According to FreeCalc assessment, cattle and goat populations would be free from disease; however, the results from sheep are not adequate to conclude that the population would be free from disease. As a conclusion, surveillance must be exercised on ruminant farms in the surroundings of the infected area in order to evaluate the possible extension of the disease and their potential role as reservoirs of T. evansi.

"Trypanosoma evansi Assessment in Equines: A Study in One Decade in an Endemic Area of the Canary Islands, Spain","Trypanosoma evansi was diagnosed in a camel in the Canary Islands for the first time in 1997, and the parasite is still present in a little area of the Archipelago. Since then, the disease has exclusively affected camel herds, and clinical evidence of the infection has not been demonstrated in any other animal hosts. In the frame of a control plan of the disease in the Archipelago, 864 equines located in the infected area were examined during one decade (2001-2010), of which a total of 26 (3%) were serologically positive but showed negative results at parasitological and molecular examinations. FreeCalc, an epidemiological tool to detect presence/absence of disease, showed that the population would be diseased at a confidence level of 99.916%. These results must suppose to implement the control plan against the disease including the equine population present in the surrounding area of the infected camel farms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Blood parasites in some birds from eastern plains of Colombia,"A total of 315 birds representing 75 species (23 families) from Villavicencio and San Miguel (Meta, Colombia) were examined for haematozoa. Fifty birds (15.9%) harbored blood parasites. Microfilariae were the most common haematozoans encountered, followed by species of the genera Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Trypanosoma. This survey included 15 new host-parasite records and 8 species of birds that were examined for haematozoa for the first time. The prevalence registered in this research was similar to others recorded in the Neotropical region, but in sharp contrast with the prevalence of blood parasites in other major land masses."
Microbiomes of North American triatominae: The grounds for Chagas disease epidemiology,
Exposure to Leishmania spp. and sand flies in domestic animals in northwestern Ethiopia,"Background: Human visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania donovani is considered an anthroponosis; however, Leishmania-infected animals have been increasingly reported in L. donovani foci, and the role of these animals as reservoirs for human L. donovani infection remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a study of domestic animals (goats, sheep, cows, dogs, and donkeys) in three L. donovani foci in northwestern Ethiopia. Domestic animals were screened for Leishmania DNA and for anti-L. donovani IgG. Serum anti-sand fly saliva antibodies were used as a marker of exposure to the vector sand fly, Phlebotomus orientalis. Results: Of 546 animals tested, 32 (5.9 %) were positive for Leishmania DNA, with positive animals identified among all species studied. Sequencing indicated that the animals were infected with parasites of the L. donovani complex but could not distinguish between L. infantum and L. donovani. A total of 18.9 % of the animals were seropositive for anti-L. donovani IgG, and 23.1 % of the animals were seropositive for anti-P. orientalis saliva IgG, with the highest seroprevalence observed in dogs and sheep. A positive correlation was found between anti-P. orientalis saliva and anti-L. donovani IgGs in cows, goats, and sheep. Conclusions: The detection of L. donovani complex DNA in the blood of domestic animals, the reported seroprevalence to the L. donovani antigen, and the widespread exposure to sand fly saliva among domestic animals indicate that they are frequently exposed to Leishmania infection and are likely to participate in the epidemiology of Leishmania infection, either as potential blood sources for sand flies or possibly as parasite hosts."
"Cross-sectional serological study of canine Leishmania infection in Fortaleza, Ceara state, Brazil","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is one of the most important reemerging parasitic disease in the world. The domestic dog is the main reservoir in urban environments. The aim of this work was to extend the knowledge on canine Leishmania infection in the city of Fortaleza in northeastern Brazil, identifying the risk factors inherent in dog susceptibility to the infection. Two populations were analyzed, domestic dogs from clinics and the Veterinary Hospital Unit of Ceara State University and stray dogs captured by the Center for Zoonosis Control in Fortaleza. Blood samples were collected and centrifuged and the sera were stored at -20 degrees C. ELISA, with soluble crude Leishmania chagasi antigens (LTCC - WDCM731) was used for diagnosis. A total of 1381 samples were tested, 750 from domestic and 631 from stray dogs. The seroprevalence of canine VL was 21.4% (135/631) in stray dogs and 26.2% (197/750) in domestic dogs. The seroprevalence of Leishmania infection in the six administrative regions of the city (Secretarias Executivas Regionais, or SER) among stray dogs was highest in SER V, representing 31.4% of the cases, with large dogs more infected (27.7%). Among domestic dogs Leishmania infection was most prevalent in SER V (38.5%) and VI (37.6%). The dogs' age (1-6 years), large size, environment with dense vegetation and presence of clinical signs compatible with Leishmania infection were associated with the illness in domestic dogs. The frequency of the infection varied seasonally. The seroprevalence was greatest in July and December. These results confirm Fortaleza is an endemic area for canine VL and suggest some variables associated with increasing infection risk in dog populations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Natural infection of cortelezzii complex (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) with Leishmania braziliensis in Chaco, Argentina","In Argentina, American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) extends up to 29 degrees S in the phytogeographic regions of the Yungas (west), Chaco (center) and Paranaense (east). Since the Phlebotominae vectors of this disease in the western Chaco (dry Chaco) are unknown, in the present work, we studied the natural infection in Phlebotominae by PCR-ERFLP and Dot blot in order to incriminate these organisms as potential vectors. Captures with CDC-type traps were performed monthly in the domicile, the peridomicile and the forest in the Municipio Mision Nueva Pompeya, Chaco, Argentina, in two sites with human cases of ACL: Los Pozos (24 degrees 54'S, 61 degrees 22'W) and Fortin Arenales (24 degrees 58'S, 61 degrees 21'W), from November 2006 to December 2007. A total of 1702 Phlebotominae were captured: Mygonemyia migonei (83.8%), cortelezzii complex (11.1%), Mycropigomyia peresi (3.3%), Mycropygomy quinquefer (1.2%), Pintomyia torresi (0.2%) and Nyssomyia neivai (0.2%). Although no significant differences were found in species diversity, there were significant differences in abundance between both sites studied. A total of 80 phlebotomine females were analyzed: 50 of the cortelezzii complex and 30 My. migonei. No intestinal flagellates were observed by light microscopy. Two pools of 10 individuals of the cortelezzii complex of the peridomicile and forest of Fortin Arenales were reactive by PCR and Dot blot for Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. In Argentina, Evandromyia cortelezzii has been incriminated as a likely vector of ACL because of its abundance in areas of sporadic outbreaks. In the present work, Ev. cortelezzii females were found naturally infected, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that the members of the cortelezzii complex act as vectors of the disease.

"Seasonal phenology, host-blood feeding preferences and natural Leishmania infection of Phlebotomus perniciosus (Diptera, Psychodidae) in a high-endemic focus of canine leishmaniasis in Rome province, Italy","A 2-year survey aimed to study seasonal phenology, host-blood feeding preferences and Leishmania infections of Phlebotomus perniciosus, was carried out in a high-endemic focus of canine leishmaniasis in Rome province, Italy. Sandfly densities were monitored by sticky traps, while CDC light traps and hand collections were used for individual sandfly analyses. Four species were identified, three belonging to Phlebotomus (P perniciosus. Phlebotomus mascittii and Phlebotomus papatasi) and one to Sergentomyia (Sergentornyia minuta) genera. In sticky traps, P. perniciosus (53.5%) and S. minuta (46.0%) were the prevalent species, whereas specimens collected by CDC light traps and hand collections consisted mostly of P. perniciosus. The study showed a markedly different sandfly density between 2003 and 2002 collections (5024 specimens versus 644 specimens, respectively), which was attributed to different climatic conditions. In 2003 adults were active during 7 months (May-November) with a typical bimodal distribution, while in 2002 their activity was shorter (5 months, June-October) without clear density peaks. In this low-density year, the prevalence of P. perniciosus was significantly higher in domestic than in wild resting sites. Blood meat tests showed that P perniciosus had no preferences for any of the two Leishmania susceptible hosts, being the forage ratio rate 0.7 and 1.0 for man and dog, respectively. A significant number of P perniciosus was found with avian (60.3%) or ovine (24.2%) blood, that was in relation with the habitats where fed specimens were collected. The rate of specimens of P perniciosus without blood and found positive for Leishmania DNA, detected by a sensitive nested-PCR technique, was much higher (27.6%) than the promastigote infection rate determined by microscopy in the dissected females (1.4%). The intense Leishmania transmission in the study area was confirmed by the high prevalence of anti-leishmanial antibodies in dogs (33.3%). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Serological survey of Leishmania infantum and Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs from urban areas of Brazil and Colombia,"Leishmania infantum and Trypanosoma cruzi are zoonotic parasites that are endemic throughout many parts of Latin America. Infected dogs play an important role in transmission of both parasites to humans. A serological survey of Leishmania and Trypanosoma infection was conducted on 365 dogs from Sao Paulo, Brazil and Bogata, Colombia, South America. Serum samples were examined by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Anti-Leishmania IgG antibodies were detected in 5 of 107 from Brazil (4.7%) and in 4 of 258 dogs (1.6%) from Colombia. Titers ranged from 1:25 to 1: 100. Anti-T cruzi antibodies were not detected in any of the dogs from either Brazil or Colombia. The results show a low prevalence of anti-Leishmania antibodies and no antibodies against T cruzi in these canine populations. Our study suggests that dogs play a limited role in the spread of L. infantum and T cruzi in these urban areas of Brazil and Colombia. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi Antibodies in Dogs from Virginia,"Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi are zoonotic protozoan parasites that cause disseminated infections in many vertebrate species. The present study determined the seroprevalence of T. gondii and Tr. cruzi in a population of dogs from Virginia. Serum samples were tested from 90 domestic dogs collected from animal shelters in Virginia. Using an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test, sera were examined at a 1 : 50 dilution and antibodies to T. gondii were found in 19 dogs (21%). Antibodies to Tr. cruzi were determined by qualitative immunochromatographic dipstick assay. One (1%) of the 90 dogs had Tr. cruzi antibodies and it was also seropositive for T. gondii. Our findings indicate that dogs are frequently exposed to T. gondii in Virginia, but that antibodies to Tr. cruzi are rare in the same geographical region."
SEROLOGIC SURVEY OF ANTIBODIES TO TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI IN COYOTES AND RED FOXES FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND TENNESSEE,"Trypanosoma cruzi is a zoonotic parasite of humans and other mammalian hosts with distribution throughout the Americas. Domestic and wild canine species are reservoirs for human T. cruzi infections. The present study examined the prevalence of antibodies to T. cruzi in wild canids from the United States. Sera from 13 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and 263 coyotes (Canis latrans), originating in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, were assayed for antibodies to T. cruzi with immunochromatographic tests. Antibodies to T. cruzi were found in 2 of 276 (0.72%) of all wild canids tested. Both T. cruzi-positive wild canids were coyotes and represented 2 of 21 (9.52%) wild canids assayed from Tennessee. Antibodies to T. cruzi were not detected in red fox. Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were not found in any wild canids from Pennsylvania. These results suggest that coyotes are exposed to T. cruzi in Tennessee but not in Pennsylvania."
"Seroprevalence of Canine Leishmaniasis and American Trypanosomiasis in Dogs From Grenada, West Indies","Canine leishmaniasis and American trypanosomiasis (AT) are caused by related hemoflagellated parasites, Leishmania spp. and Trypanasoma cruzi, which share several common host species. Dogs are reservoirs for human infections by both pathogens. We determined the prevalence of antibodies to Leishmania spp. and T. cruzi in dogs from Grenada. West Indies. We examined 70 dog sera using the qualitative immunochromatographic dipstick tests (ICTs) based on recombinant antigens specific for visceral leishmaniasis and AT. Antibodies to visceral Leishmania were not detected in Grenadian dogs by ICT. Using the canine dipsticks for AT. antibodies to T. cruzi were determined in 3 (4.3%) of the 70 dogs. Results from this study indicate that dogs in Grenada arc exposed in low levels to T. cruzi, but not to visceral Leishmania spp. at all."
Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania mexicana in Free-Ranging Howler Monkeys in Southeastern Mexico,"Natural infection of wild mammals by protozoa parasites is quite common in nature. For Neotropical Primates different infections of parasites that are etiological agent of disease in human have been identified. In particular, infections by Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania sp., have been reported for some New World primate species, but there are no reports of infection with these parasites in any primate species in Mexico. A serological study was conducted on two howler monkey species (Alouatta pigra and A. palliata) from the Mexican states of Campeche and Tabasco. A total of 55 serum samples (20 samples from A. pigra, 20 samples from A. palliata, and 15 samples from semifree ranging A. palliata of Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz as negative controls) were analyzed for the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. cruzi and Leishmania mexicana through enzyme linked immunosorbent assay test, indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western blot. The overall prevalence of antibodies in howler monkeys was 17.5% for T. cruzi and 30% for L. mexicana. Our results also indicate that A. pigra is more susceptible to develop leishmaniasis than A. palliata. Finally, the finding of positive serology in these primates should be given serious consideration for public health, given the potential role of these primate species as wild reservoirs for these diseases and the increasing contact of monkeys with human populations due to habitat loss and fragmentation.

FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI EXPOSURE AMONG DOMESTIC CANINES IN TENNESSEE,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease, is enzootic in animal populations of the southeastern United States. In the United States, T cruzi prevalence has been reported for over 20 different wildlife species, and 7 autochthonous human cases have been documented since 1955. Previous canine (Canis familiaris) serosurveys have been limited either by small sample size or confined geographic reporting areas. In this study, we report a seroprevalence of 6.4% among 860 canines from 31 counties and 5 ecoregions throughout Tennessee, using an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA). Statistically significant associations between seropositivity and age, weight, and outdoor living were noted. Differences in seropositivity were not seen based on American Kennel Club (AKC) group, sex, habitat, land cover, and ecoregion. Greater attention should be given to possible T cruzi transmission in Tennessee and veterinarians should consider Chagas' disease as a differential diagnosis with compatible signs."
The incidence of new and the prevalence and persistence of recurrent trypanosome infections in cattle in southwest Ethiopia exposed to a high challenge with drug-resistant parasites,"A method is described for calculating new infection incidence from monthly field data collected between April 1994 and February 1998 from an average of 770 Ethiopian Highland Zebu cattle maintained under traditional management in the Ghibe valley, southwest Ethiopia and exposed to a high challenge with drug-resistant parasites. Each month cattle with a packed cell volume (PCV) < 26% and detected as parasitaemic, or cattle showing clinical signs of trypanosomosis, were treated with diminazene aceturate at 3.5 mg/kg body weight. An infection was defined as a new infection if it was preceded by 2 previous months in which both samples had a PCV <greater than or equal to> 26% and were not detected with trypanosomes. Using this definition the average monthly incidence of infections of Trypanosoma congolense in cattle over 36 months of age was 13.3%, and the prevalence of recurrent infections 13.0%. Assuming that an animal had recovered from infection when PCV again returned to 26% without parasites being detected, mean persistence of infection was 3.8 months (median between 2 and 3 months). In contrast, T. vivax infections were susceptible to diminazene. The incidence of T. vivax infections in adults was lower than for T. congolense (2.8%), and they were less pathogenic (mean reduction of 3.1% units of PCV due to T. vivax infection compared with 4.6% units for T. congolense). Also, fewer cases were treated. Calves were first detected parasitaemic at an average age of 8.8 months and their infections persisted longer than those in adults. The effect of age on incidence of infection was not significant beyond 15 months of age. Adult male cattle appeared to be more susceptible to T. congolense infection than adult female cattle.

"EPIDEMIOLOGY OF BOVINE TRYPANOSOMIASIS IN THE GHIBE VALLEY, SOUTHWEST ETHIOPIA .2. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIATIONS IN TRYPANOSOME PREVALENCE, INCIDENCE OF NEW INFECTIONS AND PREVALENCE OF RECURRENT INFECTIONS","An average of 840 East African Zebu cattle from nine herds in the Ghibe valley, southwest Ethiopia were monitored from January 1986 to April 1990. Each month blood samples were collected for analysis of packed red cell volume (PCV) and detection of trypanosomes. Animals found to be parasitaemic and with a PCV less than 26% were treated with diminazene aceturate at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg body weight. The majority of infections were associated with Trypanosoma congolense (84% of infections in adult cattle and 71% in cattle less than 24 months of age), and the mean percentage of adult animals detected parasitaemic 1 month after treatment of an infection with T. congolense was 27%. In order to assess possible existence of drug resistance, a model was applied which allowed monthly incidences of new infections to be distinguished from recurrent infections. This model showed that the monthly incidence of new infections of T. congolense in adult cattle increased significantly from 11% in 1986 to 24% in 1989 following a concomitant increase in the tsetse challenge. The corresponding increase in overall prevalence of T. congolense was from 17% to 38% and the mean prevalence of recurrent infections increased significantly from 6% to 14%. These findings ruled out the possibility that the high prevalence of trypanosome infections in cattle was due only to a high tsetse challenge and pointed to the existence of T. congolense populations which expressed resistance to diminazene. There were variations associated with season, herd, age and sex in the incidence of new infections, prevalence of recurrent infections and relapse to treatment."
"The role of domestic animals in the epidemiology of human african trypanosomiasis in Ngorongoro conservation area, Tanzania","Background: Trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the trypanosome parasite and transmitted by the tsetse fly vector. In Sub-saharan Africa, both the human and animal variants of the disease are a great obstacle towards agriculture, development, and health. In order to better understand and therefore combat Trypanosomiasis, characterizing disease hotspots across species is critical. Methods: In this study, 193 samples from cattle, sheep, and goats were collected from eight sites. Samples were taken from animals belonging mostly to Maasai herdsmen in the Ngorongoro Crater Conservation Area (NCA) and analysed for the presence of trypanosomiasis infection using PCR techniques. Those that tested positive for T. brucei parasite were further tested using SRA LAMP technique to check for T. brucei rhodesiense, the human infective subspecies of parasite. Results: Our study found a high incidence of Trypanosoma brucei infections across species. Of animals tested, 47 % of cattle, 91.7 % of sheep, and 60.8 % of goats were infected. Most of the infections were of the T. brucei species. We also identified sheep and goats as carriers of the T. brucei rhodesiense subspecies, which causes acute human trypanosomiasis. Conclusions: Together, these results point toward the need for stricter control strategies in the area to prevent disease outbreak."
"Detection of Leishmania sp in Rattus rattus in the city of Corrientes, Argentina","Leishmaniasis is an important public health problem in tropical and subtropical countries worldwide. The identification of natural hosts of Leishmania is fundamental to better understand the epidemiology of the disease. The importance of rodents as reservoir hosts for different Leishmania species have already been described in different countries, however there are not reports of this situation in Argentina. The aim of this work was to capture rodents in the city of Corrientes, Argentina and detect Leishmania spp. in spleens of rodents through molecular analysis using nested PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) technical and by light microscopy to detect amastigotes. The results showed that sixty four rodents were collected, sixty three of them were identified as Rattus rattus and only one as Mus musculus. Positive results were obtained by Nested PCR, Leishmania DNA was detected in 43.7% of 64 tissue samples (first round of nested PCR), 46.8% (second round of nested PCR) and 3.1% by light microscopy. This is the first report of its kind where synanthropic rodents were found to be naturally infected by Leishmania spp. in Corrientes city, Argentina. Further studies are needed to evaluate other organs and to differentiate Leishmania species."
Honey bee and bumblebee trypanosomatids: specificity and potential for transmission,"1. Experimental studies of multihost parasite dynamics are scarce. Understanding the transmission dynamics of parasites in these systems is a key task in developing better models of parasite evolution and to make more accurate predictions of disease dynamics. 2. Bumblebee species (Bombus spp.) host the trypanosomatid parasite, Crithidia bombi. Its transmission in the field occurs through the shared use of flowers. Flowers are a perfect scenario for inter-taxa transmission of diseases because they are used by a wide range of animals. 3. Honey bees host a poorly studied trypanosomatid, Crithidia mellificae. In this study, five questions have been experimentally addressed: (a) Can C. bombi infect honey bees? (b) Can C. mellificae infect bumblebees? (c) Can the honey bee act as a vector for C. bombi? (d) Are C. bombi cells present in honey-bee faeces? (e) Does C. bombi have an effect on the mortality of honey bees after ingestion? 4. While both parasites were found to be specific to their hosts at the genus level, results suggest that honey bees may play a role in the epidemiology of C. bombi transmission."
"The opossum Didelphis virginiana as a synanthropic reservoir of Trypanosoma cruzi in Dzidzilche, Yucatan, Mexico","In Mexico, the role of mammals in the transmission cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi is poorly known. In the State of Yucatan, an endemic area of Chagas disease, both Didelphis virginiana and D. marsupialis occur sympatrically. However, until now, only the former species had been found infected with T. cruzi. To evaluate the role of D. virginiana in a peridomestic transmission, nine periods of capture-recapture were performed around the village of Dzidzilche, Yucatan. The sex, age, reproductive status, location, and presence of infection with T. cruzi were recorded for each opossum. The chromosome morphology was used to identify the opossum species. T. cruzi was identified by the presence of pseudocysts of amastigotes in cardiac muscle fibers of Balb/c mice inoculated with strains isolated from opossums. However xenodiagnosis was the best diagnostic method. Triatoma dimidiata, the vector, were collected in and around the opossums' nests, and human dwellings; and were checked for T. cruzi. From 102 blood samples of D. virginiana examined 55 (53.9%) were positive to T. cruzi, the only two D. marsupialis captured were negative. Significant differences were found between infection, and both sex and reproductive condition. Eight out of 14 triatomines collected in peridomestic nests (57.1%), and 32 of 197 captured inside houses (16.3%) were found infected, suggesting a peridomestic transmission. The statistically high abundance of infected opossums and triatomines during the dry season (March to May) suggested the existence of a seasonality in the peridomestic transmission of T. cruzi in Dzidzilche."
"Temporal Analysis of the Honey Bee Microbiome Reveals Four Novel Viruses and Seasonal Prevalence of Known Viruses, Nosema, and Crithidia","Honey bees (Apis mellifera) play a critical role in global food production as pollinators of numerous crops. Recently, honey bee populations in the United States, Canada, and Europe have suffered an unexplained increase in annual losses due to a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Epidemiological analysis of CCD is confounded by a relative dearth of bee pathogen field studies. To identify what constitutes an abnormal pathophysiological condition in a honey bee colony, it is critical to have characterized the spectrum of exogenous infectious agents in healthy hives over time. We conducted a prospective study of a large scale migratory bee keeping operation using high-frequency sampling paired with comprehensive molecular detection methods, including a custom microarray, qPCR, and ultra deep sequencing. We established seasonal incidence and abundance of known viruses, Nosema sp., Crithidia mellificae, and bacteria. Ultra deep sequence analysis further identified four novel RNA viruses, two of which were the most abundant observed components of the honey bee microbiome (similar to 10(11) viruses per honey bee). Our results demonstrate episodic viral incidence and distinct pathogen patterns between summer and winter time-points. Peak infection of common honey bee viruses and Nosema occurred in the summer, whereas levels of the trypanosomatid Crithidia mellificae and Lake Sinai virus 2, a novel virus, peaked in January."
"Epidemiological Study on Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in an Endemic Area, of Qom Province, Central Iran","Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is one of the most important health problems in many areas of Iran. There are two forms of the disease in Iran, anthroponotic and zoonotic CL. This study conducted to assess the epidemiological situation of CL in an endemic area of Qom Province, central Iran from Apr to Nov 2015. Methods: The sticky paper traps and aspirating tubes were used for collecting adult sand flies. Sherman traps and small insect nets were used to capture rodents and small mammals. Giemsa staining was used for preparing the expanded smear and followed by PCR for identifying the causative agent in human, vectors, and reservoirs. In this study, relative frequency of CL was also calculated. Results: Fourteen species of Phlebotomine sand flies were collected. Phlebotomus papatasi (61.74%) was the predominant species through the period of activity. Overall, 62 Meriones libycus, 8 Nesokia indica, 4 Mus musculus, 16 Allactaga elater and 2 Hemiechinus auritis were caught. PCR technique showed 6 out of 150 P. papatasi (2%), two out of 62 M. libycus (3.23%) and all of suspected human's skin tissue samples (100%) were infected with Leishmania major. The relative frequency of CL was 0.30%. Conclusion: This is the first detection of L. major within P. papatasi, M. libycus and human in Kahak District in Qom Province of Iran. Zoonotic cycle of CL exists in this area, L. major is the causative agent, P. papatasi is the main vector and M. libycus is the main reservoir of the disease."
"Interaction between environmental and racial factors on the prevalence of hemotropics in dual purpose bovine females in Araucanas flooded savannas, Colombia","The objective of this work was to determine the prevalence of hemotropics A. marginale, Babesia spp. and Trypanosoma spp. and environmental and genetic interactions in milking cows of the dual purpose system in the Municipality of Arauca, Colombia. A blood sample from the middle coccygeal vein was collected from 333 female bovines of different ages, located on 18 livestock farms, and the inclusion criterion was only the females that were milked at each farm. Sampling was performed for convenience in summer and winter. Samples were analyzed using Wright and Hemacolor (R) techniques. The racial groups were: Cebu (n = 157), Criolla (n = 14), Criolla x Cebu (n = 32), Mestiza (n = 64), Brown x Cebu (n = 22), Simental x Cebu (n = 16) and Holstein x Cebu (n = 5). Through contingency tables the percentage amount of animals positive to hemotropics was determined. The data were processed in Infostat; 72.22% of farms were positive for A. marginale; 66.66% for Trypanosoma spp and 16.66% for Babesia spp. The overall prevalence was 43.54%, the most frequent hemoparasite was A. marginale, (24.92%), followed by Trypanosoma spp, (14.41%) and Babesia spp (4.2%). No mixed infections were identified. A significant association (P = 0.0001) of the farms with the three hemoparasites was observed; A. marginale was dependent on the racial group (P = 0.0046), Babesia spp and A. marginale had time-of-year dependence (P < 0.05), Anaplasma marginale was related to females of more than five births (P = 0.0410) and the number of deliveries showed no interaction (P > 0.05). It is concluded that in the Araucanian floodplain region the highest prevalence of hemoparasites was associated with A. marginale and Trypanosoma spp, Animals with a predominance of taurus are more susceptible than Creoles and the interactions are given to general management, sanitary program, time and agroecological location of livestock farms."
Probing Mixed-Genotype Infections I: Extraction and Cloning of Infections from Hosts of the Trypanosomatid Crithidia bombi,
Risk factors associated with Trypanosoma cruzi exposure in domestic dogs from a rural community in Panama,"Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection, is a zoonosis of humans, wild and domestic mammals, including dogs. In Panama, the main T. cruzi vector is Rhodnius pallescens, a triatomine bug whose main natural habitat is the royal palm, Attalea butyracea. In this paper, we present results from three T. cruzi serological tests (immunochromatographic dipstick, indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA) performed in 51 dogs from 24 houses in Trinidad de Las Minas, western Panama. We found that nine dogs were seropositive (17.6% prevalence). Dogs were 1.6 times more likely to become T. cruzi seropositive with each year of age and 11.6 times if royal palms where present in the peridomiciliary area of the dog's household or its two nearest neighbours. Mouse-baited-adhesive traps were employed to evaluate 12 peridomestic royal palms. All palms were found infested with R. pallescens with an average of 25.50 triatomines captured per palm. Of 35 adult bugs analysed, 88.6% showed protozoa flagellates in their intestinal contents. In addition, dogs were five times more likely to be infected by the presence of an additional domestic animal species in the dog's peridomiciliary environment. Our results suggest that interventions focused on royal palms might reduce the exposure to T. cruzi infection."

Molecular epidemiology of camel trypanosomiasis based on ITS1 rDNA and RoTat 1.2 VSG gene in the Sudan,"Background: Internal transcribed spacer one (ITS1) of the ribosomal DNA is known to be a suitable target for PCR-based detection of trypanosomes. The analysis of this region provides a multi-species-specific diagnosis by a single PCR. Using ITS1 primer-based PCR, a cross sectional study was carried out in the period from September to November 2009 on samples collected from 687 camels from geographically distinct zones in the Sudan to detect all possible African trypanosomes, which can infect camels. Results: The results showed that all PCR-positive camels were infected with a single parasite species; Trypanosoma evansi. The highest prevalence, 57.1% (117/205), was observed in the Butana plains of mid-Eastern Sudan and the lowest, 6.0% (4/67), was in the Umshadeeda eastern part of White Nile State. In another experiment, the RoTat 1.2 gene encoding the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) of T. evansi was analyzed for its presence or absence by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using T. evansi species-specific primers. The study showed that the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene was absent in thirteen out of thirty T. evansi-positive samples. Conclusions: It is concluded that camel trypanosomiasis in Sudan is apparently caused by a single parasite species T. evansi and there were no other typanosomes species detected. In addition, the disease is highly prevalent in the country, which strengthens the need to change control policies and institute measures that help prevent the spread of the parasite. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular diagnosis report, which gives a picture of camel trypanosomiasis covering large geographical areas in Sudan."
Molecular detection of equine trypanosomes in the Sudan,"Equine trypanosomosis (ET) is a protozoan disease affecting equines in many parts of the world. We examined 509 samples collected from geographically distinct regions in eastern, central and western Sudan to estimate the endemicity of ET using the generic ITS1-PCR diagnostic methods. Results revealed that horses and donkeys were infected by Dypanosoma brucei subgroup, Trypanosoma vivax, Trypanosoma simiae and Dypanosoma congolense. The prevalence of Trypanosoma spp. was higher in horses (12.7%, n = 393) than in donkeys (3.4%, n = 116). The highest prevalence was observed in South Darfur State (19.3%, n = 202), followed by Kassala State (15.1%, n = 86), Gadaref State (3.7%, n = 82), and Khartoum State (2.6%, n = 76). No trypanosomes were detected in the 63 samples collected from North Kurdofan State. We report for the first time the presence of T. simiae and T. congolense in horses in the Sudan. This study should alert veterinary services, authorized bodies to take action toward ET by undertaking countrywide epidemiological studies of the disease and adopting control strategies.

Molecular prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of Theileria annulata and Trypanosoma evansi in cattle in Northern Tunisia,"The present study aimed to estimate the molecular prevalence of Theileria annulata and Trypanosoma evansi infection in cattle in Northern Tunisia. A total number of 96 cattle from five farms were evaluated. T.annulata and T.evansi prevalences were 61% [56/66] and 10% [7/13], respectively, at a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, while co-infection was present in 6% [4/8] of the tested animals at a CI of 95%. There was a significant correlation between age and the prevalence of T.annulata infection, whereas, there was no significant association shown with the age of cattle and T.evansi infection. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the T.annulata Tams1 gene and T.evansi ITS1 rDNA gene were highly conserved with 97.1-100% and 98.3-100% sequence identity, respectively."

"Molecular evidence of Leishmania infantum in Ixodes ricinus ticks from dogs and cats, in Italy","Leishmaniosis, caused by Leishmania infantum, is an endemic zoonosis in the Mediterranean basin. To date, phlebotomine sand flies are the only accepted biological vectors of Leishmania parasites to dogs and humans. The absence of the primary vector in autochthonous Leishmania outbreaks suggests a possible role of fleas or ticks as alternative vectors. In this study, 119 ticks were collected between August 2007-June 2008 and between March 2010-October 2010 from various animal species and humans living in Italian areas where canine leishmaniosis is endemic (i.e. rural areas of the North) and were tested for the presence of L. infantum DNA. Nine (7.5%) out of 119 ticks resulted PCR positive. All ticks were morphologically identified as Ixodes ricinus ticks, 3 from 1 cat, 6 from 4 dogs. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of L. infantum DNA in ticks from cat, suggesting that the debate about the epidemiological role of ticks in canine leishmaniosis might be extended to feline leishmaniosis."
Impact of Anthropogenic Disturbance on Native and Invasive Trypanosomes of Rodents in Forested Uganda,"Habitat disturbance and anthropogenic change are globally associated with extinctions and invasive species introductions. Less understood is the impact of environmental change on the parasites harbored by endangered, extinct, and introduced species. To improve our understanding of the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on such host-parasite interactions, we investigated an invasive trypanosome (Trypanosoma lewisi). We screened 348 individual small mammals, representing 26 species, from both forested and non-forested habitats in rural Uganda. Using microscopy and PCR, we identified 18% of individuals (order Rodentia) as positive for trypanosomes. Further phylogenetic analyses revealed two trypanosomes circulating-T. lewisi and T. varani. T. lewisi was found in seven species both native and invasive, while T. varani was identified in only three native forest species. The lack of T. varani in non-forested habitats suggests that it is a natural parasite of forest-dwelling rodents. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic disturbance may lead to spillover of an invasive parasite (T. lewisi) from non-native to native species, and lead to local co-extinction of a native parasite (T. varani) and native forest-dwelling hosts."
"Leishmaniasis eco-epidemiology in the Alpujarra region (Granada province, southern Spain)","An eco-epidemiological study was carried out in the region of the Alpujarras (southern Spain, Granada province). Nine villages were chosen at random in 5 bioclimatic zones. A study of leishmaniasis in the canine and human populations, was carried out concentrating especially upon schoolchildren. A total of 615 dogs were screened, which represents almost 100% of the canine census. Of the screened dogs, 33 showed an antibody titer greater than or equal to 1/160 when tested by IFA (seroprevalence of 5.3%). Age, sex, activity, and clinical symptoms of each dog were taken into account. Among the human population, infection from Leishmania was studied using the Leishmanin skin test (LST). Of 1286 people who were tested, 568 (44.16%) were positive. Most of the subjects were schoolchildren (878; practically 100% of the pupils), of whom 288 (32.8%) tested positive. A close relation was seen to exist between the percentage of positive LST's and age. Finally, a close relationship was also observed between canine seroprevalence and percentage of schoolchildren who tested positive in the LST, in the 5 bioclimatic zones under consideration."
"Leishmania (Viannia) Infection in the Domestic Dog in Chaparral, Colombia","Peridomestic transmission of American cutaneous leishmaniasis is increasingly reported and dogs may be a reservoir of Leishmania (Viannia) in this setting. We investigated the prevalence of infection in dogs in Chaparral County, Colombia, the focus of an epidemic of human cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis. Two (0.72%) of 279 dogs had lesions typical of cutaneous leishmaniasis that were biopsy positive by kinetoplast DNA polymerase chain reaction-Southern blotting. Seroprevalence was 2.2% (6 of 279) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Buffy coat and ear skin biopsy specimens were positive by polymerase chain reaction-Southern blotting in 7.3% (10 of 137) and 11.4% (12 of 105) of dogs, respectively. Overall 20% of dogs (21 of 105) showed positive results for one or more tests. Amplification and sequencing of the Leishmania 7SL RNA gene identified L. guyanensis in one dog and L. braziliensis in two dogs. No association was identified between the risk factors evaluated and canine infection. Dogs may contribute to transmission but their role in this focus appears to be limited."
"A Surveillance Program on Canine Leishmaniasis in the Public Kennels of Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy","Since 2007, a canine leishmaniasis (CanL) surveillance program has been carried out in public kennels of the Emilia-Romagna region with the aim of providing health guarantees for dog adoptions. According to this program, monitoring activities were performed to verify the presence of sandflies and infected dogs, and a specific CanL risk class was assigned to each kennel, resulting in different control approaches (entomological and/or serological monitoring, clinical surveillance, therapeutic treatment of infected dogs, protections against vector bites). From 2007 to 2012, 20,931 dogs, 89.8% of which were identified by microchip and housed in 73 kennels, were examined using an indirect fluorescent antibody test. In all, 528 (2.8%) dogs tested positive, and 43.0% of these were asymptomatic. The authors used monitoring results, in particular serological tests performed on dogs at admittance to the kennel and annual controls of sentinel dogs, to estimate CanL risk in the whole region and to evaluate the efficacy of the preventive measures adopted. CanL seroprevalence in dogs tested at the admittance in kennels increased significantly from 2010 (1.0%; 29/2858) to 2012 (2.4%; 69/2841). In contrast, the number of seroconversions in sentinel dogs was stable in 2010 (1.2%; 11/896) and 2011 (1.6%; 13/825) and decreased in 2012 (0.9%; 8/850), suggesting the efficacy of the preventive measures applied."
"High frequency of visceral leishmaniasis in dogs under veterinary clinical care in an intense transmission area in the state of Tocantins, Brazil","A direct search for parasites were used as the diagnostic test to determine the frequency of Leishmania spp. infection in dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) under veterinary clinical care in the city of Araguauina, Tocantins, Brazil. For this approach, lymph node cell samples were collected using needle aspiration from 649 dogs of different breeds and ages. Two hundred and sixty four (40.7%) dogs tested positive for amastigote forms of Leishmania spp. Furthermore, 202 (76.5%) dogs that tested positive showed some clinical sign of disease, while 62 (28.4%) dogs were asymptomatic. Dogs < 2 years old or those that lived alongside poultry species in peri-domicile areas had a greater chance of infection (P<0.05). Our results revealed the importance of frequently monitoring leishmaniasis in dogs, and the need to train veterinary professionals who work in high-transmission areas on the clinical diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis."
"Genetic Structure of Lutzomyia longipalpis Populations in Mato Grosso Do Sul, Brazil, Based on Microsatellite Markers","Background: Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae) is the major vector of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum and thus plays a crucial role in the epidemiology of American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL). This vector is the best studied species of sand fly in the Neotropical region. Many studies claim that this vector is in fact a species complex; however there is still no consensus regarding the number of species that belong into this complex or the geographical distribution of sibling species. The aim of the present study was to analyze the genetic relationships within Lu. longipalpis populations in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Brazil. Methodology/Principal Findings: We collected 30 Lu. longipalpis (15 females and 15 males) from five localities (Campo Grande, Tres Lagoas, Aquidauana, Miranda and Bonito) and 30 Lu. Cruzi from Corumba totaling 180 sandflies from MS, and 30 Lu. longipalpis from Estrela de Alagoas, state of Alagoas (AL), Northeast Brazil. We show that eight previously described microsatellite loci were sufficient in distinguishing Lu. longipalpis from Lu. Cruzi, which is a closely related species, and in differentiating between Lu. longipalpis collected in MS versus Estrela de Alagoas. Analyses of the genotypes revealed introgression between sympatric Lu. longipalpis and Lu. Cruzi. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support the hypothesis of cryptic species within the Lu. longipalpis complex. Furthermore, our data revealed introgression between Lu. longipalpis and Lu. cruzi. This phenomenon should be further investigated to determine the level and incidence of hybridization between these two species. We also demonstrated that microsatellite markers are a powerful tool for differentiating sand fly populations and species. The present study has elucidated the population structure of Lu. longipalpis in MS and, by extension, the Neotropical Lu. longipalpis complex itself."
Seasonality of sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) and Leishmania DNA detection in vector species in an area with endemic visceral leishmaniasis,"BACKGROUND Leishmaniases are a serious health problem in southeast Brazil, including the city of Belo Horizonte (BH), Minas Gerais state (MG), where there are high rates of incidence and mortality due to visceral leishmaniases. BH is divided into nine sanitary districts (SD) of which one, the Venda Nova SD, was selected for this study because it has high rates of positivity for canine leishmaniasis and high incidence of human leishmaniasis. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to survey the sand fly fauna in Venda Nova SD from August 2011 to July 2013 and perform a descriptive analysis of the vector population. METHODS The sampling was carried out using automatic HP light traps at all covered areas of the Venda Nova SD, in a total of eighteen light traps. Sampled specimens were identified following Galati (2003), and females were submitted to molecular techniques for the detection and identification of Leishmania DNA. A simple environmental description was done for it area and Kernel estimation was used to infer vector density for each study site. FINDINGS A total of 2,427 sand fly specimens belonging to eight species and five genera were collected of which 95.3% were Lutzomyia longipalpis. The seasonal variation curve was delineated by this species. Lu. longipalpis was the most abundant at all collection points and in all months of the study, and exhibited a natural infection rate of 1.01% for Leishmania infantum and 1.77% for Leishmania braziliensis. MAIN CONCLUSIONS The results show the presence and adaptation of Lu. longipalpis to the anthropic environment of BH and reinforces its role as the main vector of L. infantum in the region."
"Epidemiology of chagas disease in Jaguaruana, ceara, Brazil. I. Presence of triatomines and index of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in four localities of a rural area","In order to assay the triatomine infestation and domiciliation in the rural area of Jaguaruana district, state Of Ceara, Brazil, we studied, from November 2000 to April 2002, 4 localities comprising 158 domiciles as a whole, with an average of 4 inhabitants/house, who are dwelling in there for more than 7 years. Most houses have tile-covered roofs and the walls built with plaster-covered bricks (57%), followed by bricks without plaster (33%), and mud walls (7.5%). A total of 3082 triatomines were captured from different locations, according to the following capture plan: (a) intradomiciles: 238 Triatoma brasiliensis, 6 T. pseudomaculata, 9 Rhodnius nasutus, and 2 Panstrongylus lutzi; (b) peridomiciles (annexes): 2069 T. brasiliensis, 223 T. pseudomaculata, 121 R. nasutus, and I P. lutzi; (c) wild, in carnauba palms (Copernicia prunifera): 413 R. nasutus. From the captured triatomines, 1773 (57.5%) were examined. The natural index of Trypanosoma cruzi infection ranged from 10.8% to 30.2% (average of 17%), depending on the species and the location from where the triatomines were captured."
"Eco-epidemiology of Chagas disease in northeastern Brazil: Triatoma brasiliensis, T. pseudomaculata and Rhodnius nasutus in the sylvatic, peridomestic and domestic environments","An entomological survey was carried out in four rural localities situated in the state of Ceara, assessing Chagas disease seroprevalence in man, focusing on the presence of vectors in natural foci contiguous to the domestic and peridomestic environments. Fifty-three Triatoma brasiliensis, nine T. pseudomaculata and 71 Rhodnius nasutus were collected in their natural habitats as far as 10 m from the houses, and 663, 59 and 8 respectively were captured in peridomestic artificial structures, adjacent to the houses, including henhouses, pigpens, corrals, perches and piles of bricks, tiles and wood. Within the households, 37T. brasiliensis, one specimen of T. pseudomaculata and one of R. nasutus were captured. Overall, Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates were 2.3% for T. brasiliensis and 11.3% for R. nasutus. Despite that the seroprevalence survey in man did not reveal positive results using two serological techniques, natural triatomine habitats are juxtaposed to man-made artificial ecotopes, resulting in overlapping habitats. The contiguity between natural ecotopes and human dwellings increases the interaction between vectors and humans, challenging continuous surveillance and vector control efforts."
Trans-Sialidase Inhibition Assay Detects Trypanosoma cruzi Infection in Different Wild Mammal Species,"The detection of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mammals is crucial for understanding the eco-epidemiological role of the different species involved in parasite transmission cycles. Xenodiagnosis (XD) and hemoculture (HC) are routinely used to detect T. cruzi in wild mammals. Serological methods are much more limited because they require the use of specific antibodies to immunoglobulins of each mammalian species susceptible to T. cruzi. In this study we detected T. cruzi infection by trans-sialidase (TS) inhibition assay (TIA). TIA is based on the antibody neutralization of a recombinant TS that avoids the use of anti-immunoglobulins. TS activity is not detected in the co-endemic protozoan parasites Leishmania spp and T. rangeli. In the current study, serum samples from 158 individuals of nine wild mammalian species, previously tested by XD, were evaluated by TIA. They were collected from two endemic areas in northern Argentina. The overall TIA versus XD co-reactivity was 98.7% (156/158). All 18 samples from XD-positive mammals were TIA-positive (co-positivity, 100%) and co-negativity was 98.5% (138/140). Two XD-negative samples from a marsupial (Didelphis albiventris) and an edentate (Dasypus novemcinctus) were detected by TIA. TIA could be used as a novel tool for serological detection of Trypanosoma cruzi in a wide variety of sylvatic reservoir hosts."
Detection of Leishmania infantum in captive wolves from Southwestern Europe,"The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in a wild reservoir host (Canis lupus) throughout an endemic area for the disease (Southern Europe). For that reason, the serum and peripheral blood samples of 33 captive wolves from the European Breeding of Endangered Species Programme (EEP) were analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). L. infantum was detected in three samples from Central Portugal and Central and Northern Spain. Even though L. infantum infection in positive samples was low, surveillance of zoonotic leishmaniosis in this population is recommended as the parasite load could be higher in other tissues due to parasite tropism and most of the EEP institutions studied are located in endemic areas for canine leishmaniosis in Europe.

PREVALENCE AND MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF TRYPANOSOMA (MEGATRYPANUM) MINASENSE IN THE PERIPHERAL BLOOD OF SMALL NEOTROPICAL PRIMATES AFTER A QUARANTINE PERIOD,"Neotropical primates of the Cebidae and Callitrichidae, in their natural habitats, are frequently infected with a variety of trypanosomes including Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes a serious zoonosis, Chagas' disease. The state of trypanosome infection after a 30-day quarantine period was assessed in 85 squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) and 15 red-handed tamarins (Saguinus midas), that were wild-caught and exported to Japan as companion animals or laboratory animals, for biomedical research, respectively. In addition to many microfilariae of Mansonella (Tetrapetalonema) mariae at a prevalence of 25.9%, and Dipetalonema caudispina at a prevalence of 3.5%, a few trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma (Megatrypanum) minasense were detected in Giemsa-stained thin films of blood from 20 squirrel monkeys at a prevalence of 23.5%. Although few T. minasense trypomastigotes were found in Giemsa-stained blood films from tamarins, a buffy-coat examination detected trypanosomes in 12 red-handed tamarins (80.0%), and PCR amplification of a highly variable region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA genes (SSU rDNA) for Trypanosoma spp. detected the infection in 14 of the 15 tamarins (93.3%). Nucleotide sequences of the amplicons were identical for trypanosomes from tamarins and squirrel monkeys, indicating a high prevalence but low parasitemia of T. minasense in imported Neotropical nonhuman primates. Based on the SSU rDNA and 5.8S rDNA, the molecular phylogenetic characterization of T. minasense indicated that T. minasense is closely related to trypanosomes with Trypanosoma theileri-like morphology and is distinct from Trypanosoma (Tejeraia) rangeli, as well as from T. cruzi. Using some blood samples from these monkeys, amplification and subsequent sequencing of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) gene fragments detected 4 trypanosome genotypes, including 2 types of T. cruzi clade, I type of T. rangeli clade, and I T. rangeli-related type, but failed to indicate its phylogenetic position based on the gGAPDH gene. Furthermore, species ordinarily classified in the Megatrypanum by morphological criteria do not form a clade in any molecular phylogenetic trees based on rDNA or gGAPDH genes."
"Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria spp. and other endoparasite infections in kennel dogs in central Italy","Prevalence and risk factors of Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria spp. and other potentially zoonotic or canine-specific endoparasite infections were assessed in 639 kennel dogs from central Italy. To this end, individual blood and fecal samples were examined using parasitological, immunological and molecular techniques. The presence of compatible clinical pictures, as well as age and gender were considered as putative risks factors. To evaluate risk factors, multivariable analysis with logistic regression and univariable analysis with a Chi square test and a Fischer's exact test were performed. Overall, 52.6% of dogs (95% CI 48.6-56.5) were found positive, while 39.6% of dogs (95% CI 35.8-43.5) were infected by potentially zoonotic species. Leishmania infantum and Dirofilaria repens showed prevalences of 2.5% (95% CI 1.5-4.1) and 2.8% (95% CI 1.7-4.5), respectively. The prevalence of cardiorespiratory parasites was 7.8% (95% CI 5.9-10.3) and included the species Angiostrongylus vasorum, Eucoleus aerophilus, Eucoleus boehmi and D. immitis; the latter showed a prevalence of 0.2% (95% CI 0.001-1). Intestinal parasites were significantly prevalent (38.8%, 95% CI 35-42.7) and they consisted mainly of species of major zoonotic concern, including ancylostomatids, Toxocara canis, Giardia duodenalis, Dipylidium caninum, Taeniidae, Strongyloides stercoralis and Cryptosporidium parvum. Endoparasites were significantly prevalent in clinically suspected dogs. Leishmania infantum and cardiorespiratory nematodes were prevalent in older dogs, while intestinal parasites were prevalent in younger dogs. Results show high dog and public health risks in kennels in central Italy, and suggest the need for more effective control measures."
BLOOD PARASITES IN BIRDS FROM MADAGASCAR,"Madagascar has long been recognised for its unique and diverse biota. In particular, significant effort has been made to establish baseline population data to better conserve the endemic avifauna. During field expeditions between 1993 and 2004, birds were mist-netted at 11 different sites, at elevations from 60 in to 2,050 in above sea level. Data oil endemic status, forest type, and habitat preference, were recorded. Thin blood films from 947 birds, belonging to 26 families and 64 species, were examined by light microscopy to determine the prevalence of blood parasites. Of these 947 birds, 30.7% were infected by at least one species of blood parasite, 26.8% of which were infected by more than one species. Species of Haemoproteus were the it-lost prevalent (17.4%), followed by microfilariae (11.0%), Leucocytozoon spp. (9.4%), Plasmodium, spp. (1.9%), Trypanosoma spp. (0.9%), and Babesia. spp. (0.2%). Species level identifications confirmed the presence of 47 species of hemosporidians and trypanosomes, which is notably high and mirrors the diversity of their avian hosts. Eleven (23.4%) of these parasite species were new to science and thought to be endemic to the island. Significant differences ill prevalence were observed by sample site, forest type (humid vs. dry), and habitat preference. Birds front all elevational zones sampled were infected, although not all parasite genera were present in each zone. Four of the six endemic avian families or subfamilies (Bernieridae, Brachypteraciidae, Philepittinae [Eurylaimidae], and Varigidae) were sampled and found to be parasitized. Of the families with the largest sample sizes, the Zosteropidae and Ploceidae had the highest prevalence of infection (65.6% and 49.3%, respectively). The vectors of hematozoan parasites in Madagascar are currently unknown. These results add to the current knowledge of avian parasitism in Madagascar and are of particular interest for the conservation of endemic species, as well as threatened or endangered populations."
"Serological survey for American cutaneous leishmaniasis in stray dogs in the S. Paulo State, Brazil","A serological survey was made in 973 stray dogs caught near green areas in S. Paulo county by the indirect immunofluorescence test. No positive serum was found, however autochthonous human cases of ACL that occurred ill the county show the circulation of the parasite in the environment. This fact, associated with the existence of the vectors and the apparent absence of infected dogs in the areas studied suggest that stray dog plays an insignificant role in the spread of the parasite. The cycle of the parasite in Sao Paulo county has been maintained by wild animals, hence the dog would be an accidental host just as humans."
Molecular Identification of Hemoprotozoan Parasites in Camels (Camelus dromedarius) of Iran,"Background: Although camels represent a valuable source of food, wool and hide in many countries, in-depth information about their vector-borne pathogens is scarce compared to other animals. The aim of the current study was to characterize vector-borne protozoa in the blood of dromedaries from Iran by molecular tools. Methods: From June to July 2014, 200 peripheral blood samples were collected from asymptomatic one-humped camels in two provinces of Kerman and Sistan- va-Baloochestan in central and southeastern Iran. Microscopic examination was performed on Giemsa-stained blood smears, and drops of blood were spotted on Whatman FTA(R) cards for further analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from the cards, and PCR was carried out for the detection of piroplasms and trypanosomes, followed by sequence analysis of positive samples. Results: One sample was positive Trypanosoma spp. trypomastigotes in light microscopy. PCR results revealed one positive sample each with Theileria annulata and Trypanosoma evansi. Conclusion: Camels were identified as hosts for bovine Mediterranean theileriosis in the investigated area. The presence of Tr. evansi, the causative agent of surra disease, was also confirmed in camels of Iran. Further studies are recommended in order to investigate their impact on the health and productivity of camels and other livestock in this region."
Retrospective evaluation of vector-borne infections in dogs imported from the Mediterranean region and southeastern Europe (2007-2015),"BackgroundCanine vector-borne infections have gained importance in Germany due to growing tourist traffic and an increased import of dogs from abroad. Endemic regions for pathogens such as Leishmania infantum, Hepatozoon canis, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys and Dirofilaria spp. are the Mediterranean area and southeastern Europe. Babesia species and Anaplasma phagocytophilum are present all over Europe. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of vector-borne infections in dogs imported from defined endemic countries in the Mediterranean area and southeastern Europe.MethodsMedical records and laboratory test results of 345 dogs that were imported to Germany from 17 endemic countries and that were presented to the Small Animal Clinic at Freie Universitat Berlin between 2007 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 1368 test results from external laboratories were descriptively analysed including 576 and 792 test results of direct and indirect detection methods, respectively.ResultsOverall, 35% (122/345 dogs) were positive for at least one pathogen. Concurrent infections with two to four pathogens were detected in 8% of the dogs (27/345). The positive results were: L. infantum 21% (66/314 dogs; methods: PCR 20/79, IFAT or ELISA 63/308 dogs), E. canis 16% (45/278 dogs; methods: PCR 8/68, IFAT 43/257 dogs), H. canis 11% (3/28 dogs; method: PCR), Babesia spp. 10% (25/251 dogs; methods: Babesia spp. PCR 3/98, B. canis/vogeli IFAT or ELISA 22/214 and B. gibsoni IFAT 0/13 dogs), Dirofilaria spp. 7% (13/178 dogs; methods: D. immitis Ag-ELISA 8/156, Knott's test 7/95, microfilariae PCR 5/23 dogs) and A. platys 5% (1/21 dogs; method: PCR). None of 8 tested dogs were positive in a combined Babesia spp./Hepatozoon spp. PCR test.ConclusionsDogs, which are imported from countries which are endemic for vector-borne infections should be thoroughly tested using direct and indirect detection methods. Potential owners of imported dogs should be informed about the diseases, risks and incubation periods."
Prevalence of blood parasites in European passeriform birds,"Variation in the prevalence of blood parasites among species of birds has been used to test hypotheses about the effects of sexual selection and parental investment on disease resistance, and how vector abundance influences infection. However, the factors causing this variation are still poorly understood. We assessed the statistical effects of biogeographic, plumage-related and life-history traits on the prevalence of the blood parasites Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon and Trypanosoma in European passerine birds. Most of the variation in parasite prevalence occurred at low taxonomic levels. Brighter male plumage and greater host body mass were associated with higher prevalence, explaining 32% of the total variation. Male plumage brightness remained a significant factor when we controlled for phylogenetic effects. These relationships were driven primarily by simuliid-transmitted parasites (Leucocytozoon, Trypanosoma), which were more frequent in species with northern distributions. Host species with greater maximum longevity and shorter nestling periods had higher prevalences of Plasmodium; however, the effect was not stable after controlling for phylogeny using pairwise contrasts. Coevolution between hosts and parasites appears to create temporal and spatial variation that disconnects haematozoan prevalence from evolutionarily conservative life-history traits while creating some positive associations with traits that are phylogenetically labile. Clearly, ecologists should be cautious in relating patterns of variation in haematozoan prevalence to particular host traits."
"The distribution of genotypes of the trypanosome parasite, Crithidia bombi, in populations of its host, Bombus terrestris","This study reports the distribution of parasite genotypes for the trypanosome Crithidia bombi across individual units (the colonies) in host populations of a social insect, the humble bee Bombus terrestris. A number of microsatellite primers were developed and several of them were found to be polymorphic in our samples. Furthermore, a simple algorithm was used to identify the likely multi-locus genotypes present in multiply infected host individuals. The results demonstrated a remarkably high degree of genetic diversity among infections. A first sample from 1997 could only use a low resolution with 2 loci and showed a total of 11 different genotypes of C. bombi from 12 colonies. The sample from 2000 was analysed at 6 polymorphic loci and contained data from 8 colonies that were infected by 27 different C. bombi genotypes. Roughly 16% of all individual bees but half of all colonies (2000 sample) were infected with more than 1 genotype. The infections in the different colonies were also genetically distinct from each other, and the parasite population as a whole was in linkage disequilibrium and deviated from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. The highly structured and genetically diversified population of C. bombi is likely to result from strong genotypic host-parasite interactions."

"Infection prevalence and absence of positive correlation between avian haemosporidian parasites, mass and body condition in the Cape Weaver Ploceus capensis","Over a two-year period, 945 adult Cape Weavers Ploceus capensis were mist-netted with a bias towards 632 male and 308 female birds. Blood smears presented avian haemosporidia in 58.79% of males and 61.90% of females, representing five species from three genera: one avian kinetoplastid haemoflagellate Trypanosoma everetti with 0.28% infection rate, Haemoproteus queleae (69.45%), Leucocytozoon bouffardi (23.91%), and Plasmodium species (5.76%). Double infections occurred in 40 birds (11.52%), with females having the greatest number. Differences in infection prevalence between sexes was correlated to time spent being active at the nest, with a marked reduction in female infection due to incubation within a tunnel-shaped nest providing protection from vectors. Commencement of the breeding season coincided with increased parasite prevalence in both sexes, correlating to energy expenditure on reproductive effort, resulting in reduced immunocompetence. Recorded seasonal spring relapse is synchronised with peak breeding season activity, when vector intensity and activity peak due to host population increases, and avian immunodefence systems are possibly compromised due to the stress of the reproductive cycle. No negative impacts were discerned on body mass or condition during this long-term study, which may be presented when parasitemia peaks over a number of days only, thereafter decreasing in intensity."
Blood parasites in passerine birds from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,"Parasites may lead bird species to extinction, affect host temporal and spatial population dynamics, alter community structure and alter individuals' social status. We evaluated blood parasite prevalence and intensity according to bird families and species, among 925 birds that were caught in 2000 and 2001, in the Atlantic Forest in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. We applied Giemsa staining to thin blood smears, to detect blood parasites. The birds (n = 15.8%) in 1 families, were infected by at least one parasite genus, especially Muscicapidae (28.3%) and Conopophagidae (25%). Among the 146 infected birds. Plasmodium was detected in all bird families and had the highest prevalence (54.8%). Trypanosoma, Haemoproteus and microfilaria had lower prevalence rates (23.3, 23.3 and 2.1%, respectively). Birds caught during the rainy season were more infected than birds caught during the dry season. The overall low prevalence of blood parasites in birds is similar to the patterns found elsewhere in the Neotropical region."
Blood parasites in Brazilian Atlantic Forest birds: effects of fragment size and habitat dependency,"Deforestation, fragmentation and habitat disturbance may alter the relationship between pathogens and hosts. We tested, apparently for the first time, whether habitat fragmentation and degree of dependence on forests affect the prevalence of avian blood parasites. We estimated the prevalence of Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma through the inspection of 925 blood smears from 109 species captured in six pairs of small (< 30 ha) and large (> 1,000 ha) Brazilian Atlantic Forest fragments. Prevalence of the three types of parasites did not differ between small and large forest patches. Forest-independent birds were usually more infected with Plasmodium and Haemoproteus than other birds, but forest-dependent birds were more infected with Trypanosoma. Parasite richness on birds was not affected by patch size."
THE PREVALENCE OF AFRICAN ANIMAL TRYPANOSOMOSES AND TSETSE PRESENCE IN WESTERN SENEGAL,"In 2005, the Government of Senegal initiated a tsetse eradication campaign in the Niayes and La Petite Cote aiming at the removal of African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT), which is one of the main constraints to the development of more effective cattle production systems. The target area has particular meteorological and ecological characteristics that provide great potential for animal production, but it is unfortunately still infested by the riverine tsetse species Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank (Diptera: Glossinidae). The tsetse project in Senegal has adopted an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) approach that targets the entire tsetse population within a delimited area. During the first phase of the programme, a feasibility study was conducted that included the collection of entomological, veterinary, population genetics, environmental and socio-economic baseline data. This paper presents the parasitological and serological prevalence data of AAT in cattle residing inside and outside the tsetse-infested areas of the target zone prior to the control effort. At the herd level, a mean parasitological prevalence of 2.4 % was observed, whereas a serological prevalence of 28.7%, 4.4 %, and 0.3 % was obtained for Trypanosoma vivax, T congolense and T. brucei brucei, respectively. The observed infection risk was 3 times higher for T. congolense and T. vivax in the tsetse-infested than in the assumed tsetse-free areas. Moreover, AAT prevalence decreased significantly with distance from the nearest tsetse captured which indicated that cyclical transmission of the parasites by tsetse was predominant over mechanical transmission by numerous other biting flies present. The importance of these results for the development of a control strategy for the planned AW-IPM campaign is discussed."
Host specificity and incidence of Trypanosoma in some African rainforest birds: a molecular approach,"Studies of host-parasite interactions in birds have contributed greatly to our understanding of the evolution and ecology of disease. Here we employ molecular techniques to determine the incidence and study the host-specificity of parasitic trypanosomes in the African avifauna. We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic test that amplified the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA) of Trypanosoma from avian blood samples. This nested PCR assay complements and corroborates information obtained by the traditional method of blood smear analysis. The test was used to describe the incidence of trypanosomes in 479 host individuals representing 71 rainforest bird species from Cameroon, the Ivory Coast and Equatorial Guinea. Forty-two (59%) of these potential host species harboured trypanosomes and 189 individuals (35%) were infected. To examine host and geographical specificity, we examined the morphology and sequenced a portion of the SSU rRNA gene from representative trypanosomes drawn from different hosts and collecting locations. In traditional blood smear analyses we identified two trypanosome morphospecies, T. avium and T. everetti. Our molecular and morphological results were congruent in that these two morphospecies had highly divergent SSU rRNA sequences, but the molecular assay also identified cryptic variation in T. avium, in which we found seven closely allied haplotypes. The pattern of sequence diversity within T. avium provides evidence for widespread trypanosome mixing across avian host taxa and across geographical locations. For example, T. avium lineages with identical haplotypes infected birds from different families, whereas single host species were infected by T. avium lineages with different haplotypes. Furthermore, some conspecific hosts from geographically distant sampling locations were infected with the same trypanosome lineage, but other individuals from those locations harboured different trypanosome lineages. This apparent lack of host or geographical specificity may have important consequences for the evolutionary and ecological interactions between parasitic trypanosomes and their avian hosts."
Blood parasites of some west African rainforest birds,"A total of 969 birds representing 121 species of 21 families from the West African nations of Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Ivory Coast were examined for haematozoa using thin blood smears; 277 individuals (28.6%) harbored blood parasites. The parasites identified included species of Haemoproteus (7.7% prevalence), Plasmodium (10.7%), Leucocytozoon (4.6%), and Trypanosoma (7.3%). In addition, microfilariae of filariid nematodes were present in 3.6% of the individuals examined. The birds were collected over a period of 12 years, from 1989-2001, from rainforest and ecotone habitats. We report a relatively high prevalence of parasites in colonial nesting birds, and two species of ground nesting birds. In addition, we compared data from bird species collected at a site identical to a previously published study, and did not find significant differences in parasite prevalence between the two years constituting two different seasons. Our results are also compared to other studies in Africa that implement similar and different methodologies."
Cattle movements and trypanosomes: restocking efforts and the spread of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense sleeping sickness in post-conflict Uganda,"Background: The northwards spread of acute T. b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness in Uganda has been linked to cattle movements associated with restocking following the end to military conflict in 2006. This study examined the number of cattle traded from T. b. rhodesiense endemic districts, the prevalence of the parasite in cattle being traded and the level of trypanocidal treatment at livestock markets. Methods: Between 2008 and 2009 interviews were carried out with government veterinarians from 20 districts in Uganda, 18 restocking organisations and numerous livestock traders and veterinarians. Direct observations, a review of movement permit records (2006 to 2008) and blood sampling of cattle (n = 1758) for detection of parasites were also conducted at 10 livestock markets in T. b. rhodesiense endemic districts. Results: Records available from 8 out of 47 identified markets showed that 39.5% (5,238/13,267) of the inter-district cattle trade between mid-2006 and mid-2008 involved movement from endemic areas to pathogen-free districts. PCR analysis showed a prevalence of 17.5% T. brucei s.l. (n = 307/1758 [95% CI: 15.7-19.2]) and 1.5% T. b. rhodesiense (n = 26/1758 [95% CI: 0.9-2.0]) from these same markets. In a two-year period, between late-2006 to late-2008, an estimated 72,321 to 86,785 cattle (57, 857 by 18 restocking organisations and 10,214 to 24,679 by private traders) were imported into seven pathogen-free northern districts, including districts that were endemic for T. b. gambiense. Between 281 and 1,302 of these cattle were likely to have carried T. b. rhodesiense. While governmental organisations predominantly adhered to trypanocidal treatment, most Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and private traders did not. Inadequate market infrastructure, poor awareness, the need for payment for drug treatments, and the difficulty in enforcing a policy of treatment at point of sale contributed to non-compliance. Conclusion: With increasing private trade, preventing the spread of Rhodesian sleeping sickness in Uganda requires government support to ensure mandatory trypanocidal treatment at livestock markets, investment in market infrastructure and possible drug subsidy. Mapping the northern reaches of T. b. rhodesiense in livestock and preparation of risk assessments for cattle trading could mitigate future outbreaks."
"Evidence of natural infections with Trypanosoma, Anaplasma and Babesia spp. in military livestock from Tunisia","Livestock constitute habitual hosts and carriers for several infectious pathogens which may represent a serious public health concern affecting the readiness of military forces and lead to wide economic losses. The present report aimed to investigate the prevalence of some haemopathogens infecting military livestock, particularly, dromedaries, sheep and horses using Giemsa-stained blood smears. A total of 300 animals (100 from each species) were selected, clinically examined and sampled. Trypanosoma spp. (22.0%), Anaplasma spp. (17.0%) and Babesia spp. (1.0%) were identified in camels' blood. Six dromedaries were found to be co-infected by Trypanosoma and Anaplasma organisms (6.0%). Camels of female gender, infested by ticks and showing clinical signs were statistically more infected by Trypanosoma spp., compared to those of male gender, free of ticks and apparently healthy (P=0.027, 0.000 and 0.004, respectively). Babesia spp. infection (1.0%) was identified, for the first time in Tunisia, in one adult female camel that presented abortion and anemia. Anaplasma spp. was the only haemopathogen identified in examined sheep (6.0%) and horses (17.0%). Horses infested by Hippobosca equina flies and sheep infested by Rhipicephalus turanicus ticks were more infected by Anaplasma spp. than other non-infested animals (P=0.046 and 0.042, respectively). Hyalomma dromedarii, H. impeltatum and H. excavatum were the most prevalent diagnosed ticks removed from camels with an intensity of infestation of 1.2 ticks per animal. However, in sheep, only R. turanicus was identified. H. equina and Tabanus spp. were the potential hematophagous flies found in dromedaries and horses herds. This useful data must be taken into consideration during animal treatment and vectors' control programs in Tunisian military farms which help to limit the diffusion of vector-borne diseases, keep our livestock healthy and reduce economic losses."
EVORA DISTRICT AS A NEW FOCUS FOR CANINE LEISHMANIASIS IN PORTUGAL,"On the basis of information acquired from local health authorities in Evora district of Portugal on cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), an epidemiology survey study was conducted. To determine the prevalence of anti-leishmania antibodies in the local human and canine populations residing in Evora town and 14 adjacent villages, blood samples collected from 885 children and 3,614 dogs were tested in a direct agglutination test (DAT). Seropositivity for Leishmania parasite obtained by DAT in both endemic populations was further confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence test (IFAT). For identification of the responsible sandfly vector, 79 biotopes within the study areas were surveyed. In the infantile population assessed, none of the children screened showed an antibody level indicative (titer, > = 1:3200) of visceral leishmaniasis in the DAT. However, agglutinating antibody rates ranging from 0.7% to 6.9% were obtained in dogs residing in Evora and 11 adjacent villages. Concordant seropositivity of 94.04% was obtained by ELISA and IFAT in the same canine population (141) identified by DAT. Of the 159 sandflies captured, 67 were identified as Phlebotomus sergenti; 15, as P. ariasi; 58, as P. perniciosus; and 19, as Sergentomyia minuta. Unlike the results previously reported in Alto-Douro and Algarve districts of Portugal, as compared with the other three species, P. sergenti appears to be more abundant in Evora district. Considering the overall sere-prevalence rate of 3.9% obtained among the local dog population and its absence in the human at risk, it may be concluded that the endemic manifestation of L. infantum infection in Evora district is largely, if not solely, maintained in the canine host."
Development of ELISA exploring recombinant variable surface glycoprotein for diagnosis of surra in animals,"In the present study, the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene of Trypanosoma evansi was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris (X-33). The diagnostic potential of recombinant VSG (rVSG) in ELISA has been determined using 1818 field sera samples collected from different species across different states of India. The developed test was compared with the standard reference test such as, CATT/T. evansi; moreover, the new assay was also compared in ELISA using VSG RoTat 1.2 antigen. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of recombinant protein were found to be 95.4% and 93.8% respectively, with Cohen's kappa value of 0.86. The epidemiological study revealed varied prevalence of surra in different species and across different geographical regions of India. Cattle experienced higher prevalence of surra with 42.2% seropositivity from eastern region of India, whereas camel showed 19.9% seropositivity from Rajasthan. Hence, the present study is useful as an effective tool in sero-diagnosis as well as surveillance."
PLUMAGE REDNESS IN REDPOLL FINCHES DOES NOT REFLECT HEMOPARASITIC INFECTION,"An assumption of the Hamilton-Zuk model for the evolution of secondary sexual characters is that variation in the expression of these traits among conspecific individuals is a reliable indicator of their parasitic burden. Thus, if host-parasite coevolutionary processes are driving the evolution of sexual characters in a species, one expects to find a negative relationship between the exaggeration of sexual ornaments in a population of males and parasite prevalence or incidence. I analyzed hemoparasites in 97 breeding redpoll finches (Aves; Carduelinae; Carduelis f. flammea) caught at Churchill, Manitoba, in this context. Redpolls are small boreal passerines that show strong age and sexual dichromatism. In males, the extent of red patches on the breast, the rump, and to a lesser extent the crown, varies considerably. Leucocytozoon fringillinarum was the most common hemoparasite, followed by three species of Haemoproteus, and Trypanosoma avium; a large sample of Churchill common redpoll revealed no other endo- or ectoparasite. Overall, almost two thirds of the individuals sampled had blood parasites, whose prevalence or incidence did not vary significantly over the sampling period (i.e. 24 d in June). In males (n = 76), parasitic burden and size of red patches varied with host age, with one-year-old birds being significantly less frequently parasitized and less showy than older individuals. When age was taken into account, there was no relationship between parasite prevalence or incidence and plumage redness in male birds. These results provide no support for the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis."
Combined use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry to detect antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi in domestic canines in Texas,"Canines may be sentinels and/or reservoirs for human Trypanosoma cruzi exposures. This study adapted a method originally designed for human diagnostics to detect serum immunoglobulin G to T. cruzi in canines. The method combined an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for screening and flow cytometry detection of anti-live trypomastigote antibodies (ALTA) for confirmation. The assays were optimized by using known positive and negative control canine sera, and cutoff values were established. The ELISA and ALTA assay easily distinguished between reactive (positive controls) and nonreactive (negative controls) sera and were used to test sera collected in a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey of 356 domestic canines from Harris County, Tex., and the surrounding area. Fifty-three (14.9%) of 356 asymptomatic canines in the survey were positive by ELISA, and 5 (1.4%) were confirmed positive with the ALTA assay, with an additional 4 (1.1%) canines classified as ""suspect positive."" Thus, the overall prevalence of T. cruzi antibodies in this population was 2.6%. This is the first U.S. study to use the combination of ELISA and ALTA to detect serum antibodies to T. cruzi and the first report of the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in domestic canines in the Houston, Tex. (Harris County), region. Our results demonstrate that the combination of ELISA and ALTA has been successfully adapted for use in testing canines for serollogical evidence of T. cruzi infection. Seroprevalence survey results suggest that T. cruzi antibody-positive domestic canines in the peridomestic setting are present in the Houston, Tex., region and further suggest that T. cruzi is enzootic in the region."
"Prevalence of intestinal and blood parasites among wild rats in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","A survey was undertaken to investigate the prevalence of intestinal and blood parasites among wild rats in urban area of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A total of 137 stool and blood samples were collected from wild rats from Sentul and Chow Kit areas. Five species of rats were captured and supplied by Kuala Lumpur City Hall. The most common was Rattus rattus diardii (Malayan Black rat), 67%, followed by Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat), 10%, Rattus argentiventer (rice-field rat), 10%, Rattus tiomanicus (Malaysian field rat), 9% and Rattus exulans (Polynesian rat), 4%. Rattus rattus diardii is commonly known to live in human environment and they are normally identified as pests to human community. More male rats were captured (61%) compared to female (39%). Out of 137 samples, 81.8% samples were positive with intestinal parasites, with 86.2% from Sentul area and 78.5% from Chow Kit area. Six different parasites were detected. The most common intestinal helminth parasite detected was Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (80.3%), followed by Hymenolepis nana (23.4%), Capillaria hepatica (13.9%) and Hymenolepis diminuta (2.9%). Intestinal protozoan detected was Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar (8.8%). Trypanosoma lewisi (1.5%) was the only blood parasite detected."
Prevalence and molecular diagnosis of Trypanosoma evansi in Nili-Ravi buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in different districts of Punjab (Pakistan),"The prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi was investigated in 1,250 Nili-Ravi buffaloes of mixed age and sex by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the first time in Pakistan. DNA of the trypanosomes was isolated with TRIREAGENTA (R). The assay was employed using primers ESAG 6/7, specific for a 237-bp fragment from T. evansi genomic DNA. The samples were screened for the presence of T. evansi also by stained thin smear. Forty-four (3.5%) samples were positive by microscopy, while 97 (7.7%) samples were identified by PCR, indicating the high sensitivity of PCR for surveying the disease in epidemiological studies."
"The prevalence of canine Leishmania infantum infection in Sichuan Province, southwestern China detected by real time PCR","Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in western China, and becoming an important public health concern. Infected dogs are the main reservoir for Leishmania infantum, and a potential sentinel for human VL in endemic areas. In the present study we investigated the prevalence of Leishmania DNA in dogs from Wenchuan, Heishui and Jiuzhaigou County in Sichuan Province, southwestern China, which are important endemic areas of zoonotic VL, detected by real time PCR. The results will help to design control strategies against visceral leishmaniasis in dogs and humans. Results: The overall prevalence of Leishmania DNA in dogs was 24.8% (78/314) in Sichuan Province, with the positive rate of 23.5% (23/98) in Wenchuan County, 28.2% (20/71) in Heishui County, and 24.1% (35/145) in Jiuzhaigou County, and no significant difference was observed among the three counties (P > 0.05). The dogs were further allocated to different groups based on sexes, ages and external clinical symptoms. The logistic regression analysis revealed that a higher prevalence was found in older and external symptomatic dogs, compared to that of younger and asymptomatic dogs (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The results revealed that L. infantum infection in dogs is widespread in Sichuan Province, southwestern China, which has a public health significance, due to its contribution to the transmission of the infection to humans by sandflies. It is necessary to take measures, including treatment or eradication of infected dogs, to control canine leishmaniasis, which could be helpful to reduce human VL in this area."
Molecular variation in Leishmania parasites from sandflies species of a zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in northeast of Iran,"Background & objectives: In the well-known zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) focus in Turkmen Sahara, border of Iran and Turkmenistan, ZCL has increased among humans in the past five years. The present study was undertaken to incriminate vectors of ZCL in the region, and to find molecular variation in Leishmania parasites. Methods: The sandflies were sampled using CDC light-traps and sticky papers. All the sandflies were identified using morphological characters of the head and abdominal terminalia. DNA was extracted from the dissected thorax and attached anterior abdomen of individual female sandfly. Leishmania detection and identification of sandflies were performed using PCR, digestion of BsuRI restriction enzyme and sequencing of ITS-rDNA gene and also by semi-nested PCR to amplify minicircle lcinetoplast (k) DNA of Leishmania. Results: Leishmania infections were detected in 26 out of 206 female sandflies. Of the infected sandflies, 18 were Phlebotomus papatasi while eight were P caucasicus/P. mongolensis. Two infections of L. turnica were detected, one in P. papatasi and other in P. caucasicus/P. mongolensis and the rest of the sandflies were found infected with L. major. Conclusion: Our finding showed that L. major had low diversity with only one common haplotype (GenBank Access No. EF413075). The novel haplotypes were discovered in L. major (GenBank Access No. KF152937) and in L. turanica (GenBank Access No. EF413079) in low frequency. These Leishmania parasites are circulating to maintain infections in the P. papatasi and P. caucasicus/R mongolensis in Turkmen Sahara."
Detection and assessment of risk factors associated with natural concurrent infection of Trypanosoma evansi and Anaplasma marginale in dairy animals by duplex PCR in eastern Punjab,"Duplex PCR consisting of two primer sets within a single mixture for the simultaneous detection of Anaplasma marginale and Trypanosoma evansi was standardized and employed on 219 blood samples collected from cattle (165) and buffaloes (54) from eastern Punjab to evaluate the status of concurrent infection and associated risk factors. The reaction produced 257- and 407-bp amplification products targeting repetitive nucleotide sequence of T. evansi and msp1 beta gene of A. marginale, respectively. The nucleotide sequence analysis of individual amplicons expressed the fidelity of the primer pairs used; duplex PCR was 100 % sensitive and 92.66 % specific with conventional microscopy for the detection of mixed infections. Among the agro-climatic zones of interest, undulating zone was at higher risk of T. evansi infection (odds ratio (OR) = 1.75, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-3.27), and submountain zone (OR = 1.89, 95 % CI = 1.11-3.33) for A. marginale. For the concurrent infection, the relative risk among the two zones was almost unity. The cross-bred cattle population was at the highest risk of infection, may it be solo infection of T. evansi (OR = a, 95 % CI = 1.18-a)/A. marginale (OR = 6.39, 95 % CI = 1.14-125.3) or dual infection (OR = a, 95 % CI = 0.39-a) of both as the indigenous cattle are resistant to the infection. Cross-bred cattle were at approximately three times the risk than buffaloes. For the dual infection, the cattle calves were at about 2.5 times higher risk than buffalo calves. Results indicate the endemic status of these infections in the region and mark out the commodities at great risk and requiring better surveillance."
"Molecular Prevalence of Babesia bigemina and Trypanosoma evansi in Dairy Animals from Punjab, India, by Duplex PCR: A Step Forward to the Detection and Management of Concurrent Latent Infections","Specific duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed on 411 (386 cattle and 25 buffaloes) blood samples of dairy animals from 9 districts of Punjab, India, for simultaneous detection of Babesia bigemina and Trypanosoma evansi. The results were compared and correlated with conventional Giemsa stained thin blood smear (GSTBS) examination and haematological alterations to know the clinical status and pathogenicity of infections. The Bg3/Bg4 and TR3/TR4 primers were used in duplex PCR for B. bigemina and T. evansi amplified products of 689 bp and 257 bp, respectively. The overall prevalence by duplex PCR was found to be 36.49, 2.43, and 3.41% for T. evansi, B. bigemina, and dual infection, respectively. A more significant difference was observed for dual infection status (P <= 0.005) as compared to T. evansi (P <= 0.05) and B. bigemina (P <= 0.01) among various districts under study. A very low prevalence of T. evansi (0.73%) and B. bigemina (0.48%) was seen by GSTBS. The highly sensitive, specific, and cost-effective duplex PCR was able to detect latent T. evansi and B. bigemina infection in cattle and buffaloes. Haematological evaluation revealed marked pathology in B. bigemina infected group and in dual infected group in contrast to that infected with T. evansi alone."
Incidence of haemoprotozoan infection in canines in and around Mathura,
Comparative evaluation of real time PCR assay with conventional parasitological techniques for diagnosis of Trypanosoma evansi in cattle and buffaloes,"For comparative evaluation, a real time PCR assay was standardized by using TaqMan primer and probe targeting the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) region of rRNA for Trypanosoma evansi and sensitivity was evaluated by using DNA, extracted from diethyleamino ethane cellulose purified trypanosomes and trypanosomes infected whole blood of mice. The minimum detection limit for purified trypanosomal DNA was 0.01 ng (similar to 0.33 genomic DNA of T. evansi) whereas for whole blood the minimum detection limit was 0.1 ng (similar to 6.12 genomic DNA). T. evansi infected mice blood samples were collected at different interval post infection and were analysed by conventional parasitological methods (CPT) viz. wet blood smear, thin blood smear, thick blood smear, quantitative buffy coat and real time PCR and found that TaqMan assay was two fold sensitive than CPT in case of in vivo infectivity in mice and gave positive signal at 36 h post infection where as QBC and blood smear examination was able to detect at 60 h and 72 h post infection respectively. A total 109 (80 cattle and 29 buffaloes) blood samples were collected from in and around Ludhiana district and analysed by CPT and real time PCR. The overall prevalence of T. evansi by CPT in cattle and buffaloes was 2.75 per cent. The prevalence rate was 2.5 per cent in cattle and 3.45 per cent in buffaloes. By real time PCR overall prevalence was 12.84 per cent in cattle and buffaloes, with a prevalence rate of 12.50 per cent in cattle and 13.79 per cent in buffaloes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Bovine trypanosomosis and Glossina distribution in selected areas of southern part of Rift Valley, Ethiopia","Cross-sectional study was conducted in 9 selected districts of the southern part the Rift Valley, Ethiopia to estimate the dry period prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis as well as assessment of Glossina species. From a total of 1838 cattle examined for trypanosomosis by buffy coat technique 133 (7.2%) were found infected by trypanosome species. From the total positive animals 66.9 and 33.1% of them accounted to Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax, respectively. Significantly higher prevalence (19.4%., P < 0.05) was recorded at Arba-Mnch district. Black colored cattle were the most highly affected (x(2) =79.35, P < 0.05) animals. The overall average PCV value for parasitaemic and aparasitaemic animals was 22.2 (95% CI = 21.6-22.7) and 27% (95% CI = 26.8-27.2), respectively. The fly caught per trap per day was 1.4 for Glossina species and 2.8 for other biting flies. Two species of Glossina identified namely Glossina pallidipes and Glossina fuscipes.

"Native Rodent Species Are Unlikely Sources of Infection for Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis along the Transoceanic Highway in Madre de Dios, Peru","An estimated 2.3 million disability-adjusted life years are lost globally from leishmaniasis. In Peru's Amazon region, the department of Madre de Dios (MDD) rises above the rest of the country in terms of the annual incidence rates of human leishmaniasis. Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is the species most frequently responsible for the form of disease that results in tissue destruction of the nose and mouth. However, essentially nothing is known regarding the reservoirs of this vector-borne, zoonotic parasite in MDD. Wild rodents have been suspected, or proven, to be reservoirs of several Leishmania spp. in various ecosystems and countries. Additionally, people who live or work in forested terrain, especially those who are not regionally local and whose immune systems are thus naive to the parasite, are at most risk for contracting L. (V.) braziliensis. Hence, the objective of this study was to collect tissues from wild rodents captured at several study sites along the Amazonian segment of the newly constructed Transoceanic Highway and to use molecular laboratory techniques to analyze samples for the presence of Leishmania parasites. Liver tissues were tested via polymerase chain reaction from a total of 217 rodents; bone marrow and skin biopsies (ear and tail) were also tested from a subset of these same animals. The most numerous rodent species captured and tested were Oligoryzomys microtis (40.7%), Hylaeamys perenensis (15.7%), and Proechimys spp. (12%). All samples were negative for Leishmania, implying that although incidental infections may occur, these abundant rodent species are unlikely to serve as primary reservoirs of L. (V.) braziliensis along the Transoceanic Highway in MDD. Therefore, although these rodent species may persist and even thrive in moderately altered landscapes, we did not find any evidence to suggest they pose a risk for L. (V.) braziliensis transmission to human inhabitants in this highly prevalent region."
Spatial distribution and trypanosome infection of tsetse flies in the sleeping sickness focus of Zimbabwe in Hurungwe District,"Background: In Zimbabwe, cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) are caused by the unicellular protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, sub-species T. b. rhodesiense. They are reported from the tsetse-infested area in the northern part of the country, broadly corresponding to the valley of the Zambezi River. Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes, in particular T. congolense and T. vivax, also cause morbidity and mortality in livestock, thus generating poverty and food insecurity. Two species of tsetse fly, Glossina morsistans morsitans and G. pallidipes, are known to be present in the Zambezi Valley, although their distributional patterns and densities have not been investigated in detail. The present study tries to address this gap by providing some insight into the dynamics of trypanosomiasis in humans and livestock. Methods: Tsetse distribution and trypanosome infections were studied using traps and fixed fly rounds located at 10 km intervals along a 110 km long transect straddling the southern escarpment of the Zambezi Valley. Three km long fly rounds were conducted on 12 sites, and were repeated 11 times over a 7-month period. Additional traps were deployed and monitored in selected sites. Microscopic examination of 2092 flies for trypanosome infections was conducted. Results: Surveys confirmed the presence of G. morsitans morsitans and G. pallidipes in the Zambezi Valley floor. Moving south, the apparent density of tsetse flies appears to peak in the vicinity of the escarpment, then drops on the highlands. Only one fly was caught south of the old game fence separating protected and settled areas. A trypanosome infection rate of 6.31% was recorded in tsetse flies dissected. Only one infection of the T. brucei-type was detected. Conclusions: Tsetse fly distribution in the study area appears to be driven by ecological factors such as variation in land use and altitude-mediated climatic patterns. Although targeted control of tsetse flies have played a role in determining distribution, no major control operations have been implemented in the area for 15 years. Trypanosome infections in tsetse flies are consistent with HAT epidemiological data, which considers the situation to be generally 'low risk'. Nonetheless, underreporting is likely to conceal the true epidemiological picture, and efforts are needed to strengthen the diagnostic capacities of health facilities."
A Serological and Molecular Study of Leishmania infantum Infection in Cats from the Island of Ibiza (Spain),"The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection within a feline population by serologic and molecular methods and to identify associated risk factors. One hundred five cats living outdoors were studied. Sera were tested for IgG antibodies against L. infantum, Toxoplasma gondii, and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and for the detection of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) p27 antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). L. infantum real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on DNA extracted from blood. L. infantum and T. gondii seroprevalence rates were 13.2% and 55.2%, respectively. The prevalence of L. infantum by PCR was 8.7%. The total rate of L. infantum infection derived from seroreactivity and/or positive PCR was 15.4%. Serology and PCR results were positively associated, and moderate agreement (kappa = 0.489) was found between Leishmania ELISA and PCR. No statistical association was found between positive Leishmania PCR results and gender, clinical status, or T. gondii seropositivity. Six of the 105 cats (5.7%) displayed clinical signs compatible with feline cutaneous leishmaniosis, and 4 out of these 6 cats (66.7%) were found to have Leishmania infection by means of serology and/or PCR. Leishmania seropositivity was associated with clinical signs of feline cutaneous leishmaniosis (p = 0.029). The prevalence of FeLV p27 antigen was 16.2% (17/105) and of FIV antibody was 20.9% (22/105), with coinfection found in 9.5% (10/105) of the cats. Leishmania ELISA seroreactivity and positive PCR results were statistically associated with FeLV infection and with coinfection of both retroviruses but not with a positive FIV status. The high seroprevalence and molecular rates of Leishmania infection observed indicate that cats are frequently infected with L. infantum, and the association with FeLV suggests a potential role for this retrovirus in feline Leishmania infection in endemic areas."
"Canine visceral leishmaniasis in the great Athens area, Greece","A survey of 1,175 dogs with suspected visceral leishmaniasis (VL), was carried out to investigate canine leishmaniasis in the Athens basin, the largest metropolitan area of Greece. The dogs examined were not a random sample since animals were selected on the basis of symptoms indicating the disease. Dog sera were tested using the indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT), with titres greater than or equal to 1/200 considered positive for VL. On this basis 569 dogs (48.4%) were found positive for VL and 69 (5.9%) borderline (with titres of 1/100). Additionally, 218 of these sera were also tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Of this sample, 120 were negative and 88 were positive with both IFAT and ELISA (according to the slated criteria), and thus the concordance of the two methods was 98.6%. Dogs positive for VL were classified according to age, sex, breed, and area of residence. Dogs from outlying areas of the Athens basin had higher infection rates than dogs from the city. The most affected breed was the Doberman, and the least affected was the Collie."
"Asymptomatic canine leishmaniasis in Greater Athens area, Greece","Leishmania (L.) infantum is the etiological agent of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean subregion. Domestic dogs are the main reservoir of the parasite in most urban areas. A survey of 1638 asymptomatic dogs registered in Greater Athens area was carried out in the Hellenic Pasteur Institute during the period 1986-1994 to investigate the prevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis in apparently healthy dogs. Dog sera was tested using the indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT). Of the 1638 dogs, 366 (22.4%) had anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies at titre greater than or equal to 1/200 which were considered positive; 53 (3.2%) had antibody titres of 1/100 and were considered uncertain: and 1219 (74.4%) dogs were seronegative. From the 366 seropositive dogs, 212 were positive at 1/1600 serum dilution, 57 at 1/800, 38 at 1/400 and 59 at 1/200. The results were plotted according the site of residence, breed and age. The rate of asymptomatic infections with L. infantum dogs in Greater Athens area appears to be significantly high. Although there is an apparent lack of clinical symptoms in these dogs, asymptomatic animals harbor a chronic L. infantum infection and as such consist a 'dangerous' reservoir with regard to the spread of the disease."
"The distribution of tsetse (Diptera : Glossinidae) and bovine trypanosomosis in the Matutuine District, Maputo Province, Mozambique","A tsetse and bovine trypanosomosis survey was conducted during 1998 and 1999 in the Matutuine District of Maputo Province (Mozambique). A total of 59 Glossina brevipalpis and 17 Glossina austeni were captured throughout the district. Survey results suggest that Glossina brevipalpis is mainly concentrated in dense vegetation along the Maputo River and in the wetlands east of the river. G. austeni, on the other hand, was captured mainly in dense thickets in drier areas. Both tsetse species are suspected to be vectors of bovine trypanosomosis. Bovine trypanosomosis (75,5% Trypanosoma congolense) was diagnosed in 53 animals (13,9 %) from seven sampling sites distributed throughout the district. The prevalence of cattle with anti-trypanosomal antibodies was high (29,9 %). The incidence of trypanosomal infections in sentinel cattle was also high. The widespread distribution of bovine trypanosomosis and the high prevalence of infection are likely to have a significant impact on cattle production and, hence, the cattle restocking exercise in the district."
"Survey of Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum, haemotropic mycoplasmas and other arthropod-borne pathogens in cats from Albania","Background: Albania is a country on the western part of the Balkan Peninsula. The Mediterranean climate is favourable for the stable development of many arthropod species, which are incriminated as vectors for various agents. Recently, several papers have reported on epidemiological aspects of parasitic diseases including vector-borne disease agents of dogs with zoonotic characteristics in Albania. However, data on the epidemiology of feline parasitic and bacterial agents in Albania is scarce. Methods: Serum and EDTA-blood samples collected from 146 domestic cats from Tirana during 2008 through 2010 were examined for exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Leishmania infantum, and Anaplasma spp. with IFAT, for infection with L. infantum, A. phagocytophilum, Bartonella spp. and haemotropic mycoplasmas with conventional PCR and real-time PCR and for Dirofilaria immitis with antigen ELISA. Additionally blood smear microscopy was carried out for detection of blood-borne pathogens. Results: Antibodies to T. gondii (titre >= 1: 100) were demonstrated in 91 cats (62.3%). Antibodies to N. caninum (titre >= 1: 100), L. infantum (titre >= 1: 64) and Anaplasma spp. (titre >= 1: 100) were found in the serum of 15 (10.3%), 1 (0.7%) or 3 (2.1%) cats, respectively. DNA of haemotropic mycoplasmas was detected in the blood of 45 cats (30.8%), namely Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum (21.9%), Mycoplasma haemofelis (10.3%), and Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis (5.5%), with ten cats harbouring co-infections of two mycoplasmas each; blood from one cat was PCR positive for Bartonella henselae. No DNA of Leishmania spp. and A. phagocytophilum or circulating D. immitis antigen was detected in any cat sample. The overall prevalence of haemotropic mycoplasmas was significantly higher in male compared to female cats (40.6% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.0444); and age was associated positively with the prevalence of antibodies to T. gondii (p = 0.0008) and the percentage of haemotropic mycoplasma infection (p = 0.0454). Conclusions: With the broad screening panel including direct and indirect methods applied in the present study, a wide spectrum of exposure to or infection with parasitic or bacterial agents was detected."
A Novel qPCR Assay for the Detection of African Animal Trypanosomosis in Trypanotolerant and Trypanosusceptible Cattle Breeds,"This study was conducted to (i) determine the prevalence of African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT) in tsetse challenged areas, (ii) compare conventional with qPCR detection systems and (iii) evaluate the host genetic background and biology as risk factors. AAT prevalence studies are often confronted with low levels of parasitaemia. Hence, we designed a novel qPCR assay using primers and species specific probes amplifying the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) gene. Thereby all three AAT species could be detected simultaneously. 368 individuals from three cattle types (Baoule, Zebu and hybrids) originating from 72 farms in Burkina Faso were analysed. Farmers were interviewed and morphometric measurements of the cattle taken. A chi-squared test and a logistic regression model were calculated to detect associations with infection. In our study, the overall rate of prevalence detected with the novel qPCR assay was 11.14%. Compared to conventional PCR we identified a concordance of 91.30%. We tested 41 animals positive for trypanosome DNA, five animals showed multiple infections. Zebus were twice as often infected (21.74%) compared to Baoule (9.70%) and hybrids (9.57%). Trypanosoma vivax is the dominant species (9.24%), as compared to T. congolense (2.44%) and T. brucei (0.82%). The chi-squared tests linking the infection events to the breeds (Zebu vs. Baoule and Zebu vs. hybrids) were on the border of significance. No significant association with other tested parameters could be detected. We introduce a novel qPCR technique for the fast, sensitive and simultaneous detection of the three AAT species. Our results suggest that associations with breed and infection exist since Zebu cattle are more likely to be infected compared to Baoule and hybrids. Indigenous taurine cattle breeds, like the Baoule, therefore provide a unique and valuable genetic resource."
Visceral leishmaniasis in dogs from rural settlements,"In rural settlements there are higher concentrations of reservoirs and vectors of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) due to environmental changes resulting from human action by occupation of the territory, however, there are no surveys in Brazil on epidemiological information of CVL in these areas. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of Leishmania sp. in dogs from rural settlements, as well as to identify the risk factors associated with infection. A total of 306 dogs were tested, and the serological diagnosis of CVL was performed by ELISA S7. Of the 306 dogs, 118 presented anti-Leishmania sp. antibodies., resulting in a frequency of 38.6%. The risk factors identified for CVL seropositivity were: age of 12-24 months (OR=2.97), age of 24-48 months (OR=4.83), age of 4-6 years (OR= 4.40), age > 6 years (OR=3.62), contact with poultry (OR=1.67) and gender (female) (OR=1.97). Dogs from rural settlements in the semiarid of Paraiba showed high anti-Leishmania sp. antibody frequency, what makes the population of those settlements susceptible to infection. This highlights for the need to alert the epidemiological surveillance agencies to stablish prevention and control methods for that zoonosis, including educational and health activities on these settlements, as they are located in areas with favorable characteristics for CVL installation."
Outbreaks of trypanosomosis due to Trypanosoma vivax in cattle in Bolivia,"This paper reports the first occurrence of bovine trypanosomosis due to Trypanosoma vivax in Bolivia. T. vivax was identified in thin blood smears of 159 cattle from the Provinces of Velaco (57), Nuflo de Chavez (20), Guayaros (30) and Chiquitos (52), and in 86.20% of 29 cattle from Laguna Concepcion examined by microhematocrit test. The clinical signs observed were fever, anemia, abortion, progressive weakness, loss of appetite, lethargy, substantial weight loss in a relatively short time, and progressive emaciation.

Epidemiological aspects of canine visceral leishmaniasis in the semi-arid region of Paraiba and analysis of diagnostic techniques,"Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by Leishmania infantum in Brazil. It is a chronic disease and often a fatal zoonosis and considered as a serious worldwide public health problem and recognized by the World Health Organization as one of seventeen ""Neglected Tropical Diseases"". This study was conducted in 2012 in the county of Patos, in Paraiba State semiarid region. The main purposes were to estimate the prevalence and the risk factors of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL), and to evaluate the performance of serological tests. Serological prevalence was determined using three techniques (ELISA, IFA and DPP chromatographic immunoassay - Dual Path Platform). ELISA was the golden standard, since it is the confirmatory test for CVL as established by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. In total, 362 blood samples were collected and were considered positive if positive by two serological assays. Positive samples were tested by PCR and qPCR. An epidemiological questionnaire was applied to the dog owner to identify risk factors associated with CVL. The seroprevalence was 11.33% (41/362). Chromatographic immunoassay - DPP showed a sensitivity of 58% (95%, CI: 0.43 to 0.72) and specificity of 96% (95%, CI: 0.93-0.98), with a Kappa index of 0.5. The IFA had a sensitivity of 85% (95%, CI: 0.72 to 0.94), specificity of 99% (95%, CI: 0.98 to 1) and Kappa value of 0.8. The risk factor identified in the multivariate analysis was gender (OR=2.15 [1.09 to 4.21]), male dogs having 2.15 times more chance of being infected. The increased likelihood can possibly be explained by the use of male dogs for hunting and as guard dogs, two factors that increase dog contact to infected sandflies. Due to the prevalence rates, it should be recommended control measures against canine visceral leishmaniasis. The results demonstrated that the Chromatographic immunoassay (DPP-Dual Path Platform) is not the best technique for screening positive animals due to its low sensitivity, suggesting its replacement by ELISA."
"Seroprevalence and risk factors associated with canine visceral leishmaniasis in the State of Paraiba, Brazil","Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with canine visceral leishmaniasis in Paraiba State. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 411 dogs in four municipalities of Paraiba State. The seroprevalence was assessed by using ELISA. Results: The seroprevalence ranged from 7.2% to 20%. The risk factors that were associated with the disease were the presence of ticks and contact with other animals. Conclusions: The seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis is high in Paraiba, indicating the need for health authorities to resume visceral leishmaniasis control activities. The ruralization of suburban areas in the region tends to homogenize the risk factors between suburban and rural areas."
"Detection of antibodies against Leishmania infantum in cats (Felis catus) from the state of Pernambuco, Brazil","Introduction: Little information is available concerning infection by Leishmania infantum in cats. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a serological study in domestic cats. Methods: Serum samples (n=153) obtained from animals living in the cities of Recife and Petrolina, State of Pernambuco, Brazil, were tested by ELISA/S7 (R) (Biogene). Results: Anti- L. infantum antibodies were detected in 3.9% (6/153) of the cats. All seroreagent animals were from Petrolina. Conclusions: These results serve as an important alert, and future studies are needed to better understand the possible role of cats in the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in this area."

A cross-sectional study on canine Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi infection in Amazonian Brazil ratifies a higher prevalence of specific IgG-antibody response than delayed-type hypersensitivity in symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs,"This was a cross-sectional study which analyzed the prevalence and the clinical and immunological spectrum of canine Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi infection in a cohort of 320 mongrel dogs living in an endemic area of American visceral leishmaniasis in the Amazonian Brazil by using, mainly, the indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT-IgG) and the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), and the parasite research by the popliteal lymph node aspiration. The IFAT and DTH reactivity recognized three different immune response profiles: (1) IFAT((+))/DTH(-) (107 dogs), (2) IFAT((-))/DTH(+) (18 dogs), and (3) IFAT((+))/DTH(+) (13 dogs), providing an overall prevalence of infection of 43 % (138/320). Thus, the specific prevalence of IFAT ((+)) /DTH ((-)) 33.4 % (107/320) was higher than those of IFAT ((-)) /DTH ((+)) 5.6 % (18/320) and IFAT ((+)) /DTH ((+)) 4.0 % (13/320). Moreover, the frequency of these profiles among 138 infected dogs showed that the IFAT ((+)) /DTH ((-)) rate of 77.5 % (107/138) was also higher than those of 13.0 % (18/138) of IFAT ((-)) /DTH ((+)) and 9.5 % (13/138) of IFAT ((+)) /DTH ((+)) rates. The frequency of asymptomatic dogs (76 %-105) was higher than those of symptomatic (16.6 %-23) and oligosymptomatic ones (7.4 %-10). A total of 16 (11.6 %) L. (L.) i. chagasi isolates were obtained from infected dogs, all from the IFAT ((+)) /DTH ((-)) profile: 41 % (9/22) from symptomatic, 33.3 % (3/9) from oligosymptomatic, and 5.2 % (4/76) from asymptomatic dogs. These findings strongly suggested that despite the higher frequency of asymptomatic dogs (76 %-105), the majority (72.4 %-76) was characterized by the IFAT ((+)) /DTH ((-)) profile with a doubtful immunogenetic resistance against infection."
Population genetics of forest type of Trypanosoma congolense circulating in Glossina palpalis palpalis of Fontem in the South-West region of Cameroon,"Background: Genetic variation of microsatellite loci is a widely used method for the analysis of population genetic structure of several organisms. To improve our knowledge on the population genetics of trypanosomes, Trypanosoma congolense forest and savannah types were identified in the mid-guts of Glossina palpalis palpalis caught in five villages of Fontem in the South-West region of Cameroon. From the positive samples of Trypanosoma congolense forest, the genetic diversity and the population genetic structure of these parasites were evaluated. Method: For this study, pyramidal traps were set up during three entomological surveys and 3347 tsetse flies were collected, dissected and 1903 midguts collected. DNA was extracted from midguts and specific primers were used to identify Trypanosoma congolense forest and savannah. All Trypanosoma congolense forest positive samples were characterized with seven microsatellite markers. Results: Microscopic examination revealed 25 (1.31%) mid-gut infections with trypanosomes while the PCR method identified 120 (6.3%) infections due to Trypanosoma congolense: 94 (78.33%) Trypanosoma congolense forest and 28 (21.77%) Trypanosoma congolense savannah. The trypanosome infection rates varied significantly between villages and years of capture. Menji recorded the highest infection rate (15.11%); and samples captured in 2009 were more infected (14.33%). The microsatellite markers revealed a genetic variability between Trypanosoma congolense forest populations of Fontem villages and 6.38% of mixed infections due to different genotypes of T. congolense ""forest type"". Conclusion: Our data on the population genetics play in favor of a clonal reproduction of this parasite. The microsatellite markers used here showed a low genetic differentiation and an absence of sub-structuration (F-ST <= 0.0003) between Trypanosoma congolense forest populations of Fontem villages. However, the high FST value (F-ST >= 0.3911) between samples of the Democratic Republic of Congo and those of Fontem villages indicates low migration rates between trypanosomes of these subpopulations."
Population genetics of Trypanosoma brucei circulating in Glossina palpalis palpalis and domestic animals of the Fontem sleeping sickness focus of Cameroon,"Background: Human African Trypanosomiasis is still a public health threat in Cameroon. To assess Trypanosoma brucei strains circulating in the Fontem sleeping sickness focus, we conducted a genetic structure study using microsatellites to assess genotypes circulating in both tsetse flies and domestic animals. Method: For this study, pyramidal traps were set up and 2695 tsetse flies were collected and 1535 (57%) living flies were dissected and their mid- guts collected. Furthermore, blood samples were collected from 397 domestic animals (pigs, goats, sheep and dogs). DNA was extracted from midguts and blood samples, and specific primers were used to identify trypanosomes of the subgenus Trypanozoon. All positive samples were genetically characterized with seven microsatellite markers. Results: Seventy five (4.7%) midguts of tsetse flies and 140 (35.2%) domestic animals were found infected by trypanosomes of the subgenus Trypanozoon. The genetic characterization of 215 Trypanozoon positive samples (75 from tsetse and 140 from animals) revealed a genetic diversity between Trypanosoma brucei circulating in tsetse and domestic animals. Of these positive samples, 87 (40.5%) single infections were used here to investigate the population genetics of Trypanosoma brucei circulating in tsetse and domestic animals. The dendrogram illustrating the genetic similarities between Trypanosoma brucei genotypes was subdivided into four clusters. The samples from tsetse belonged to the same cluster whereas the samples from domestic animals and espcially pigs were distributed in the four clusters. Conclusion: Pigs appeared as the animal species harboring the highest number of different Trypanosoma brucei strains. They may play an important role in the propagation of different genotypes. The FST values revealed a sub structuration of Trypanosoma brucei according to hosts and sometimes villages. The data obtained from this study may have considerable importance for the understanding of the transmission and the spread of specific genotypes of Trypanosoma brucei."
Identification of different trypanosome species in the mid-guts of tsetse flies of the Malanga (Kimpese) sleeping sickness focus of the Democratic Republic of Congo,"Background: The Malanga sleeping sickness focus of the Democratic Republic of Congo has shown an epidemic evolution of disease during the last century. However, following case detection and treatment, the prevalence of the disease decreased considerably. No active survey has been undertaken in this focus for a couple of years. To understand the current epidemiological status of sleeping sickness as well as the animal African trypanosomiasis in the Malanga focus, we undertook the identification of tsetse blood meals as well as different trypanosome species in flies trapped in this focus. Methods: Pyramidal traps were use to trap tsetse flies. All flies caught were identified and live flies were dissected and their mid-guts collected. Fly mid-gut was used for the molecular identification of the blood meal source, as well as for the presence of different trypanosome species. Results: About 949 Glossina palpalis palpalis were trapped; 296 (31.2%) of which were dissected, 60 (20.3%) blood meals collected and 57 (19.3%) trypanosome infections identified. The infection rates were 13.4%, 5.1%, 3.5% and 0.4% for Trypanosoma congolense savannah type, Trypanosoma brucei s.l., Trypanosoma congolense forest type and Trypanosoma vivax, respectively. Three mixed infections including Trypanosoma brucei s.l. and Trypanosoma congolense savannah type, and one mixed infection of Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma congolense savannah type were identified. Eleven Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infections were identified; indicating an active circulation of this trypanosome subspecies. Of all the identified blood meals, about 58.3% were identified as being taken on pigs, while 33.3% and 8.3% were from man and other mammals, respectively. Conclusion: The presence of Trypanosoma brucei in tsetse mid-guts associated with human blood meals is indicative of an active transmission of this parasite between tsetse and man. The considerable number of pig blood meals combined with the circulation of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in this focus suggests a transmission cycle involving humans and domestic animals and could hamper eradication strategies. The various species of trypanosomes identified in the Malanga sleeping sickness focus indicates the coexistence of animal and human African Trypanosomiasis. The development of new strategies integrating control measures for human and animal trypanosomiasis may enable the reduction of the control costs in this locality."
Identification and genetic characterization of Trypanosoma congolense in domestic animals of Fontem in the South-West region of Cameroon,"To understand the circulation and the spread of Torpanosoma congolense genotypes in animals of Fontem in the southwest region of Cameroon, T. congolense forest and T. congolense savannah were investigated in 397 domestic animals in eight villages. Out of the 397 domestic animals, 86 (21.7%) were found infected by trypanosomes, using the capillary tube centrifugation test. The PCR with specific primers identified 163 (41.1%) and 81(20.4%) animals infected by T. congolense forest and T. congolense savannah, respectively; showing for the first time the circulation of T. congolense savannah in the Fontem region. No infection with T. congolense savannah was found in pigs whereas goats and sheep were infected by T. congolense forest and/or T. congolense savannah. The prevalence of trypanosomes varied significantly amongst villages and animal species. The genotyping of T. congolense forest positive samples using microsatellites markers showed that multiple genotypes occurred in 27.2% (44/163) of animals sampled, whereas single genotypes were found in 73.8% (119/163) of samples. Some alleles were found in all animal species as well as in all villages and were responsible for major genotypes, whereas others (rare alleles) were identified only in some animals of few villages. These rare alleles were characteristic of specific genotypes, assimilated to minor genotypes which can be spread in the region through tsetse flies. The microsatellite markers show a low genetic variability and an absence of sub-structuration within T. congolense forest. The analysis of the microsatellite data revealed a predominant clonal reproduction within T. congolense forest. Pigs were the animal species with the highest number of different genotypes of T. congolense forest. They seem to play an important epidemiological role in the propagation and spread of different genotypes of T. congolense. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"The comparative role of cattle, goats and pigs in the epidemiology of livestock trypanosomiasis on the plateau of eastern Zambia","To determine and compare the prevalence of trypanosome infections in different livestock species (cattle, pigs and goats) in areas where game animals are scarce and livestock constitute the main food source of tsetse, a survey was conducted on the plateau of the Eastern Province of Zambia in Katete and Petauke districts where Glossina morsitans morsitans is the only tsetse species present. Blood was collected from a total of 734 cattle, 333 goats and 324 pigs originating from 59 villages in both districts and was examined using the huffy coat method and the PCR-RFLP as diagnostic tools. The prevalence of trypanosome infections differed substantially between livestock species. Using microscopic diagnostic methods, trypanosome infections were detected in 13.5% of the cattle and 0.9% of the pigs. All goats were parasitologically negative. The PCR-RFLP analyses increased the trypanosomiasis prevalence to 33.5, 6.5 and 3.3% in cattle, pigs and goats respectively. The majority of the infections (91.2%) were due to Trypanosoma congolense. The presence of a trypanosome infection in cattle and pigs resulted in a significant decline in the packed cell volume. The outcome of the study clearly shows that despite the availability of goats and pigs. cattle seem to be the major livestock species affected by the disease in trypanosomiasis endemic areas. The high proportion of infections in cattle could be partly attributed to their higher availability and attractiveness to tsetse. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Molecular prevalence of trypanosome infections in cattle and tsetse flies in the Maasai Steppe, northern Tanzania","Background: African trypanosomosis is a disease of public health and economic importance that poses a major threat to the livelihoods of people living in the Maasai Steppe, where there is a significant interaction between people, livestock and wildlife. The vulnerability of the Maasai people to the disease is enhanced by the interaction of their cattle, which act as vehicles for trypanosomes, and tsetse flies close to wildlife in protected areas. This study was aimed at identification of trypanosome infections circulating in cattle and tsetse flies in order to understand their distribution and prevalence in livestock/wildlife interface areas in the Maasai Steppe. Methods: A total of 1002 cattle and 886 tsetse flies were sampled from June 2015 to February 2016 in five villages and PCR was conducted to amplify the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) from trypanosomes. All Trypanosoma brucei-positive samples were further tested for the presence of the serum resistance-associated (SRA) gene found in human-infective trypanosomes using the SRA-LAMP technique. Results: The overall prevalence of trypanosome infections was 17.2% in cattle and 3.4% in tsetse flies. Using a nested PCR, prevalence and abundance of five trypanosome species, Trypanosoma vivax, T. brucei, T. simiae, T. theileri and T. congolense, were determined, which varied with season and location. The highest prevalence of the identified trypanosome species was recorded at the end of wet season with an exception of T. brucei which was high at the beginning of the wet season. No human-infective trypanosomes were detected in both cattle and tsetse fly DNA. Conclusions: This study confirms that seasonality and location have a significant contribution to the prevalence of trypanosome species in both mammalian and vector hosts. These results are important for designing of community-wide vector and disease control interventions and planning of sustainable regimes for reduction of the burden of trypanosomosis in endemic pastoral areas, such as the Maasai Steppe in northern Tanzania."
SEROPREVALENCE OF TRYPANOSOMA EVANSI IN BUFFALOES IN SOUTH WESTERN SEMI ARID PLANE ZONE OF UTTAR PRADESH,"In present investigation seroprevalence of trypanosomosis in buffaloes were assessed using monoclonal antibody based-latex agglutination test (TE-LAT). Out of 2494 buffaloes reported, a total of 890 serum samples of suspected buffaloes were collected during the period from June, 2013 to May, 2014, from various places of south western semi arid plane zone of Uttar Pradesh. Overall sseroprevalence of 18.56% and suspected seroprevalence of 52.02% were obtained indicating endemicity of surra in buffaloes of the region. Trypanosomosis was found prevalent throughout the year in the region and higher prevalence was observed in monsoon and post monsoon months followed by winter months and least in the summer months."

TRYPANOSOMA-EVANSI INFECTION IN DOGS - SEASONAL PREVALENCE AND CHEMOTHERAPY,"A 1-year survey was undertaken to determine the incidence of Trypanosoma evansi in dogs at Ludhiana, India. Of 64 dogs examined by wet film, thin smear, thick smear and mouse inoculation, three (4.68%) were found to be positive for T. evansi. All the positive animals were detected during the rainy and post-rainy seasons. The treatment of three infected dogs with a combination of quinpyramine sulphate and chloride (3:2 w/w) resulted in complete recovery of two dogs; another dog died on the day therapy was initiated."
"A comparative evaluation of parasitological, serological and DNA amplification methods for diagnosis of natural Trypanosoma evansi infection in camels","A representative number of 217 camels (Camelus dromedarius) from different areas of western Rajasthan State, India, were examined from July 2002 to May 2003 for Trypanosoma evansi infection. The tests used were parasitological (wet blood film, WBF; stained thin blood smear, TBS), immunodiagnostic (double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for antigen detection, Ag-ELISA), and DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques were compared and the best efficiency was found for the last named (PCR). A prevalence of T evansi infection was detected in 17.05, 9.67, 4.60 and 4.14% by PCR, Ag-ELISA, TBS and WBF with a sensitivity of 100, 56.75, 27.02 and 24.32%, respectively. PCR revealed a specific 227 bp band in positive samples. The intensity of PCR bands was variable in different test samples depending upon the level of infection in the test samples. The history of intermittent fever, emaciation, oedema, poor body condition significantly correlated with positive serological status in ELISA as well as trypanosome DNA detection by PCR.

Prevalence of infection by the microsporidian Nosema spp. in native bumblebees (Bombus spp.) in northern Thailand,"Bumblebees (tribe Bombini, genus Bombus Latreille) play a pivotal role as pollinators in mountain regions for both native plants and for agricultural systems. In our survey of northern Thailand, four species of bumblebees (Bombus (Megabombus) montivagus Smith, B. (Alpigenobombus) breviceps Smith, B. (Orientalibombus) haemorrhoidalis Smith and B. (Melanobombus) eximius Smith), were present in 11 localities in 4 provinces (Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, Chiang Rai and Nan). We collected and screened 280 foraging worker bumblebees for microsporidia (Nosema spp.) and trypanosomes (Crithidia spp.). Our study is the first to demonstrate the parasite infection in bumblebees in northern Thailand. We found N. ceranae in B. montivagus (5.35%), B. haemorrhoidalis (4.76%), and B. breviceps (14.28%) and N. bombi in B. montivagus (14.28%), B. haemorrhoidalis (11.64%), and B. breviceps (28.257%)."
"Biting flies and Trypanosoma vivax infection in three highland districts bordering lake Tana, Ethiopia","An epidemiological study was conducted to determine the prevalence of trypanosomosis in cattle, small ruminants and Equidae, and to identify biting flies; potential mechanical vectors of trypanosomes in the three districts of Bahir Dar Zuria, Dembia and Fogera, bordering lake Tana, Ethiopia. About 1509 cattle, 798 small ruminants and 749 Equidae were bled for the prevalence study using the buffy-coat method and the measurement of the hematocrit value. Sixty-six NGU and 20 monoconical traps were deployed for the fly survey. The results indicated the presence of trypanosomes in 6.1% (92/1509) of the cattle with a maximum during the late rainy season (9.6%) than the early dry season (3.6%) at Fogera district. Prevalence at the district level varied from 4% to 9.6%. Only one sheep (1/122) and one goat (1/676) were found positive for T vivax-like trypanosomes and none of the Equidae was positive. All the trypanosomes encountered in cattle belong to the single species of T vivax. The PCV was negatively associated with detection of T vivax (21.6% in infected versus 25.4% in non-infected cattle). A total of 55,398 biting flies were caught of which 49,353 (89.08%) belong to Stomoxys, 4715 (8.51 %) to horse flies and 1330 (2.4%) to Chrysops species. There was no tsetse fly. Species identification has indicated the presence of Atylotus agrestis, Chrysops streptobalia, Stomoxys calcitrans, S. nigra, S. pulla, S. pallida, S. sitiens, S. taeniata, S. uruma, Haematopota lasiops and Hippobosca variegata. The overall apparent density was 214.7 flies/trap/day. Seasonal comparison showed higher fly catches in the lite rainy season than the early dry season. This study indicated that T vivax infections culminate in cattle at the same time as mechanical vectors such as Stomoxys sp. and Arylotus agrestis. Therefore, attention towards T vivax infection in cattle is essential to control the impact of the disease on productivity. A further study on biting flies is recommended. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Prevalence study on Trypanosoma vivax in dairy cattle in the Western region on the State of Parana, Brazil","In Brazil, Trypanosoma vivax is present in several states. The disease is endemic in Pantanal and Minas Gerais. In Parana there is still no report of the parasite, but due to the state borders with Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo, Paraguay and Argentina, it is believed that the protozoan circulates in the region without diagnosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of T. vivax in dairy cattle in the western region of Parana. For this purpose, 600 blood samples and 400 serum samples were collected from dairy cattle, distributed in 60 and 40 properties, respectively. While buffy coat smears were performed on blood samples, serum samples were used in Indirect Immunofluorescence Reaction. All samples, in both techniques, presented negative results for T. vivax. These results indicate that the studied hemoprotozoan is not circulating among the cattle in the western region of Parana. However, future work evolving beef cattle must be carried out and preventive measures should be adopted in order to avoid the entry of the parasite in the State of Parana."
Prevalence and characterization of Trypanosoma species from livestock of Cholistan desert of Pakistan,"Trypanosomiasis is one of the most pathogenic infection of livestock caused by several Trypanosoma species. The current study aims to determine the current prevalence of trypanosomiasis in livestock of Cholistan desert, Pakistan by molecular characterization. A total 272 animals, 61 camels, 59 cattle, 50 goats, 50 sheep and 52 donkeys that were bled and processed for thin smear microscopy, packed cell volume (PCV), DNA extraction, PCR, formol gel test and for cryo preservation. For diagnosis and molecular characterization, three sets of primers including TBR, RoTat 1.2, TRYP4 were used which detect their targets including repeated satellite DNA region, variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene and the ITS ribosomal DNA sequence of microbe. According to results, 6.2% animals were positive by microscopy, 51.1% by formol gel, 54.7% by PCV and 36.7% by PCR. The results of this study support the idea that PCR is a sensitive, robustic and reliable technique to diagnose trypanosomiasis and it should be added in conventional setup along with microscopy to avoid false negative and positive results. The PCR based order of prevalence of trypanosomiasis in Cholistani livestock was sheeps>camels>donkeys>goats>cattle. Similary, on the basis of thin smear microscopy the prevalence of trypanosomiasis was donkeys>camels>sheep>goats>cattle. It was observed that Trypanosoma evansi is the most prevalent specie involved in trypanosomiasis in Cholistani livestock."
Characterization of widespread canine leishmaniasis among wild carnivores from Spain,"Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is an emerging zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Leishmania infantum in Mediterranean countries, with sand flies (Phlebotomus spp.) as vectors and dogs as the main domestic reservoir. The role of wild carnivores in the epidemiology of leishmaniasis is still controversial. In order to determine the prevalence of natural infection with L. infantum in wild carnivores from Spain, we analyzed 217 samples by PCR and western blotting and used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to compare the patterns present in wild carnivores with those of domestic dogs from the same areas. DNA of the parasite was detected in spleen or blood samples from 35 (16.12%) analyzed wild carnivores, including 8 of 39 (20.5%) wolves (Canis lupus), 23 of 162 (14.1%) foxes (Vulpes vulpes), 2 of 7 (28.6%) Egyptian mongooses (Herpestes ichneumon), 1 of 4 genets (Geneta geneta), and 1 of 4 Iberian lynxes (Lynx pardinus). No significant sex or age differences in prevalence were observed in wolves and foxes (P > 0.05), but there was a significant difference among regions in foxes (P < 0.05). A total of 12 PCR-RFLP patterns were found in foxes, 6 in wolves, 4 in dogs, 2 in Egyptian mongooses and 1 in lynx and genet. RFLP patterns differed between dogs and foxes in the two areas where they could be compared. This is the first study of canine leishmaniasis in wild canids and other carnivores from different regions of Spain by PCR. The prevalence of infection indicates the existence of natural infection in apparently healthy wild carnivore populations, and our results are suggestive of a sylvatic cycle independent of dogs.

Polymerase chain reaction as a diagnosis tool for detecting trypanosomes in naturally infected cattle in Burkina Faso,"African animal trypanosomoses constitute the most important vector-borne cattle diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Generally it is considered that there is a great lack of accurate tools for the diagnosis of the disease. During a trypanosomosis survey in the agro-pastoral zone of Sideradougou, Burkina Faso, 1036 cattle were examined for trypanosomes using microscopy. The PCR was applied on a subset of 260 huffy-coat samples using primers specific for Trypanosoma congolense savannah and riverine-forest groups, T. vivax, and T. brucei. Parasitological examination and the molecular technique were compared, showing a better efficiency of the latter. In the near future, the PCR is Likely to become an efficient tool to estimate the prevalence of African trypanosomoses in affected areas. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
A serological study of exposure to arthropod-borne pathogens in dogs from northeastern Spain,"There is limited information regarding the prevalence of many vector borne pathogens in Europe and especially in Spanish dogs. We investigated 206 sick and 260 clinically healthy dogs from three different regions in northeastern Spain for antibodies to Rickettsia conorii (Rc), Ehrlichia canis (Ec), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap), Bartonella henselae (Bh), Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii (Bvb), Leishmania infantum (Li) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) and for antigen of Dirofilaria immitis (Di). Total prevalences were the following: Rc (56.4%), Li (30%), Ec (16.7%), Bh (16.8%), Ap (11.5%), Bvb (1.07%), Di (0.6%) and Bb ( 0.6%). Seroprevalences for Rc, Ec, Ap, Bh, and Bvb and Bb and Di antigens were similar among the three different study sites. The Ec seroprevalence, as determined by Snap 3DX, was statistically lower in dogs from Mallorca (0%) than Tarragona (16%) and Barcelona (5%) ( P < 0.0001). Detection of Rc antibodies was associated with seroreactivity to Ec and Ap antigens ( P = 0.018 and P = 0.002, respectively). IFA Ec antibodies were associated with Ap seroreactivity ( P < 0.0001). There was no association between the clinical status, sex, time of the year when samples were collected, life-style or exposure to fleas or ticks and a positive test result for Ec, Bh, Bvb, or Bb antibodies or Di antigens. Li seroreactivity was associated with illness and living outdoors ( P < 0.0001, P = 0.029; respectively), Rc seroreactivity with the male gender ( P = 0.028) and Ap seroreactivity with living outdoors ( P = 0.045). This study indicates that exposure to Rc, Li, Ec or related Ehrlichia spp., Bh and Ap or a related spp., is common whereas Di, Bb and Bvb is uncommon among dogs from the Mediterranean basin. We also provide serological data that suggests the existence of a novel Ehrlichia species on Mallorca island."
Prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in dogs living in an area of canine leishmaniasis endemicity using PCR on several tissues and serology,"We studied and compared the prevalence of leishmania infection and the seroprevalence and the prevalence of canine leishmaniasis in an area where canine leishmaniasis is endemic. One hundred dogs living on the island of Mallorca (Spain) were studied. In this study, we clinically examined each dog for the presence of symptoms compatible with leishmaniasis, determined the titer of anti-Leishmania antibodies, and investigated the presence of Leishmania DNA by PCR in skin, conjunctiva, and bone marrow samples of each dog, The prevalence of the disease and the seroprevalence were 13 and 26%, respectively. In 63% of the dogs, Leishmania DNA could be detected by PCR in at least one of the tissues studied. The results of positive PCR in the bone marrow, the conjunctiva, and the skin were 17.8, 32, and 51%, respectively. The prevalence of the infection, 67%, was calculated using all animals that were seropositive and/or positive by PCR with any tissue. The results showed that the majority of dogs living in an area where canine leishmaniasis is endemic are infected by Leishmania and that the prevalence of infection is much greater than the prevalence of overt Leishmania-related disease."
Detection of Leishmania infantum DNA mainly in Rhipicephalus sanguineus male ticks removed from dogs living in endemic areas of canine leishmaniosis,"Background: Sand flies are the only biologically adapted vectors of Leishmania parasites, however, a possible role in the transmission of Leishmania has been proposed for other hematophagous ectoparasites such as ticks. In order to evaluate natural infection by Leishmania infantum in Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks, taking into account its close association with dogs, 128 adult R. sanguineus ticks removed from 41 dogs living in endemic areas of canine leishmaniosis were studied. Methods: Individual DNA extraction was performed from each tick and whole blood taken from dogs. Dog sera were tested for IgG antibodies to L. infantum antigen by ELISA and L. infantum real-time PCR was performed from canine whole blood samples and ticks. Results: Leishmania infantum PCR was positive in 13 ticks (10.1%) including one female, (2.0%) and 12 males (15.2%), and in only five dogs (12.2%). Male ticks had a significantly higher infection rate when compared to female R. sanguineus. The percentage of L. infantum seroreactive dogs was 19.5%. All but two PCR positive dogs were seroreactive. Leishmania infantum PCR positive ticks were removed from seropositive and seronegative dogs with a variety of PCR results. Conclusions: This study demonstrates high prevalence of L. infantum DNA in R. sanguineus ticks removed from L. infantum seropositive and seronegative dogs. The presence of L. infantum DNA was detected mainly in male ticks possibly due to their ability to move between canine hosts and feed on several canine hosts during the adult life stage. Additional studies are needed to further explore the role of R. sanguineus ticks and in particular, male adults, in both the epidemiology and immunology of L. infantum infection in dogs in endemic areas."
Evaluating the Accuracy of Molecular Diagnostic Testing for Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis Using Latent Class Analysis,"Host tissues affected by Leishmania infantum have differing degrees of parasitism. Previously, the use of different biological tissues to detect L. infantum DNA in dogs has provided variable results. The present study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of molecular diagnostic testing (qPCR) in dogs from an endemic area for canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) by determining which tissue type provided the highest rate of parasite DNA detection. Fifty-one symptomatic dogs were tested for CVL using serological, parasitological and molecular methods. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed for accuracy evaluation of these methods. qPCR detected parasite DNA in 100% of these animals from at least one of the following tissues: splenic and bone marrow aspirates, lymph node and skin fragments, blood and conjunctival swabs. Using latent variable as gold standard, the qPCR achieved a sensitivity of 95.8% (CI 90.4-100) in splenic aspirate; 79.2% (CI 68-90.3) in lymph nodes; 77.3% (CI 64.5-90.1) in skin; 75% (CI 63.1-86.9) in blood; 50% (CI 30-70) in bone marrow; 37.5% (CI 24.2-50.8) in left-eye; and 29.2% (CI 16.7-41.6) in right-eye conjunctival swabs. The accuracy of qPCR using splenic aspirates was further evaluated in a random larger sample (n = 800), collected from dogs during a prevalence study. The specificity achieved by qPCR was 76.7% (CI 73.7-79.6) for splenic aspirates obtained from the greater sample. The sensitivity accomplished by this technique was 95% (CI 93.5-96.5) that was higher than those obtained for the other diagnostic tests and was similar to that observed in the smaller sampling study. This confirms that the splenic aspirate is the most effective type of tissue for detecting L. infantum infection. Additionally, we demonstrated that LCA could be used to generate a suitable gold standard for comparative CVL testing."
Cutaneous leishmaniasis: an epidemiological study in southwest of Iran,
"Trypanosomatid prevalence in Nezara viridula (L.), Euschistus heros (Fabricius) and Piezodorus guildinii (Westwood) (Heteroptera : Pentatomidae) Populations in Northern Parana, Brazil","The stink bug complex in soybeans has a great potential to cause damage, their control has been difficult due to high population densities at the end of the season. Studies related to entomopathogenic organisms in stink bugs are interesting for their possibilities to be used as biological control agents and because they could be an etiological agent in mass rearing. We determined the prevalence of trypanosomatids in the most important species of the stink bug complex in soybean, from Brazil, Nezara viridula (L.), Euschistus heros (Fabricius) and Piezodorus guildinii (Westwood). Insects were collected in soybean and on alternate hosts during the intercrop season. Hemolymph drops from each adult were mounted on slides and observed under microscope; stink bug numbers with and without flagellates were recorded. The flagellates found in P guildinii or E. heros populations were smaller than that found in N. viridula. The higher prevalence of the trypanosomatids was observed on soybean reaching a peak of 30% of the sampled N. viridula specimens in January, 2001, and 44% prevalence in February 2003. The maximum prevalences (16%) in P guildinii were observed in January and February, 2003 and on July 27, 2003 with 20% of the specimens infected. Flagellates in the hemolymph of E. heros were less frequent (maximum prevalence of 8.7%), suggesting that this species is less susceptible than X viridula and P guildinii. Trypanosomatid prevalence was higher than that observed for entomopathogenic fungi, however they seem to be inefficient control agents in short term condition."
Seroepidemiological survey of Leishmania infantum infection in dogs from northeastern Portugal,"Northeastern Portugal is a region where canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is endemic. In this study, a seroepidemiological survey was conducted in 654 dogs from that geographical area. Serum samples were evaluated by the direct agglutination test (DAT) and also by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using five different defined antigens. Seroprevalence of infection was 21.3% based on the assumption that seropositive animals were positive for at least three tests. A high degree of agreement was found between DAT and LAM-ELISA (89%; kappa value [kappa]= 0.67). A statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) of seropositivity was found between adult (23.4%) and juvenile dogs (12.2%), apparently healthy (14.8%) and sick dogs (40.2%), vaccinated (19.7%) and non-vaccinated (41.2%) animals, seropositive (26.9%) and seronegative (18.0%) for Toxoplasma gondii, living in rural (18.5%) or urban (32.6%) areas, and between animals living exclusively outdoors (18.2%) and those living in a mixed habitat (27.5%). Risk factors for canine Leishmania infection, as defined by multiple logistic regression analysis, were of clinical status (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1) and Toxoplasma infection (OR= 1.5).

Canine visceral leishmaniasis in riverside communities of the Cuiaba river watershed,"Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic zoonosis expanding in Brazil. Several municipalities in the state of Mato Grosso including those on the river Cuiaba have reported the incidence of both human and canine cases and the identification of sandfly vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis and Lu. cruzi. Dogs are considered the main reservoir of Leishmania chagasi in the urban areas, hence, we devised a cross-sectional study aimed at assessing the prevalence of the infection in the dogs of riverside communities on Cuiaba River watershed by parasitological (parasitic isolation in culture), serological, and molecular methods. Of the 248 surveyed dogs, 24 were positive in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), with a prevalence of 9.7%. The riverside communities located in the town of Santo Antonio do Leverger displayed a higher prevalence of the disease than the cities of Cuiaba and Varzea Grande; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Dogs born in the communities had a 3.24-fold higher risk of acquiring the infection. Promastigote were isolated in the axenic culture from the bone marrow samples and intact skin. Further, DNA of Leishmania sp. was detected in the bone marrow samples, lymph nodes, leukocyte cover, and skin of only one examined dog. These samples were sequenced and they showed 99% homology to L. infantum. To conclude, we observed a higher prevalence of infection in Riverside communities of Santo Antonio do Leverger and the confirmation of autochthony in these areas justifies the surveillance actions to minimise the risk of transmission within the riverine community itself, besides its dissemination to other areas by tourism."
"CLINICAL STUDY OF NATURAL INFECTION BY Trypanosoma cruzi IN DOGS RESIDING IN A RURAL AREA IN MATO GROSSO DO SUL STATE, BRAZIL","This study was carried out to describe the clinical characteristics of natural infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs that reside in a rural area of Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. Conventional and nonconventional diagnostic methods were used for screening T. cruzi infection in 75 dogs that lived in the area. Cardiovascular tests and biochemical examination of sera were also performed in four confirmed positive dogs. The following techniques were employed: indirect immunofluorescence test (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with T. cruzi epimastigote antigens (EAE-ELISA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with T. cruzi excreted-secreted trypomastigote antigens (TESA-ELISA) with antibodies detected in 45.33% (n = 34), 24.0% (n = 18) and 12.0% (n = 9) of the dogs, respectively. The current prevalence of the infection was confirmed as 10.7% (n = 8) by immunoblotting test with T. cruzi excreted-secreted antigens (TESA-blot). The test that showed the best concordance index (Kappa; 0.93), sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98.5%) was TESA-ELISA, that when associated with IFAT had the same results as those obtained by TESA-blot (10.7%). Three out of the four chagasic animals showed enlarged cardiac silhouette on X-ray and an increase of the P-wave duration and QRS complex in electrocardiogram. Two dogs presented conduction disturbances, right bundle branch block in one dog and first-degree atrioventricular block and sinus arrest in another. The ecodopplercardiography presented left-ventricular-wall thickness increased during diastole, decrease of the shortening fraction and inversion in the speed peaks of the E and A waves, indicating the presence of systolic and diastolic disorders. The four animals showed enzymatic activities of creatine kinase (221-404 U/L), MB fraction of creatine kinase (189-304 U/L), elevated total proteins (7.6-10.2 g/dL) and total globulins (4.6-7.7g/dL) and reduction of albumin/globulin ratio, which suggested a myocardial injury and continuous antigenic stimulus."
"Seroprevalence of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs in a rural area of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil","Chagas disease is an anthropozoonosis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and dogs are considered to be one of the main reservoirs of the disease in the South America. This study evaluates the occurrence of the infection caused by T. cruzi in dogs from a rural area of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Indirect immunofluorescence test (IFI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used in 75 dogs living in this area. The antibodies were detected in 45.3% (n=34) and 24.0% (n=18) with IFI and ELISA, respectively. The actual prevalence of the infection was confirmed as 22.7% (n=17) by the criterion of positivity in both tests. The results confirm T. cruzi infection in dogs in the region."
"Baseline survey of animal trypanosomosis in the region of the Boucle du Mouhoun, Burkina Faso","In view of gathering baseline information about the prevalence of animal trypanosomosis, the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) funded a cross sectional survey in the region of the Boucle du Mouhoun which constitutes the Northern limit of the tsetse distribution in Burkina. This cross sectional study was carried out in 53 villages located in the six provinces of the region. A total of 2002 cattle, 1466 small ruminants and 481 donkeys were sampled. This survey showed that about 25% Of the cattle had been treated with trypanocidal drugs within 3 months before the survey compared to 3% and 0.42% for the small ruminants and donkeys, respectively. Parasitological prevalence in cattle was low: 0.77% (95% C.I. 0.30-1.95%). No goats and three donkeys were found infected with trypanosomes. Infections were mainly due to Trypanosoma vivax (75.0%) with cases of Trypanosoma congolense (25.0%). In cattle, the serological prevalence of trypanosomosis, for the entire region of the Boucle du Mouhoun, was 34.2% (95% C.I. 26.1-43.4%). For sheep, goats and donkeys, the prevalence were of 20.9% (95% C.I. 12.2-33.5%), 8.5%(95% C.I. 5.7-12.5%) and 5.8% (95% C.I. 3.9-8.6%), respectively. The age and distance to the river were the two main risk factors associated with seropositivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Field detection of resistance to isometamidium chloride and diminazene aceturate in Trypanosoma vivax from the region of the Boucle du Mouhoun in Burkina Faso,"A longitudinal study assessed the chemoresistance to isometamidium chloride (ISM) and diminazene aceturate (DA) in the region of the Boucle du Mouhoun in Burkina Faso. A preliminary cross-sectional survey allowed the identification of the 10 villages with the highest parasitological prevalences (from 2.1% to 16.1%). In each of these 10 villages, two herds of approximately 50 bovines were selected, one being treated with ISM (1 mg/kg b.w.) and the other remaining untreated as control group. All animals (treated and untreated herds) becoming infected were treated with DA (3.5 mg/kg b.w.). In total, 978 head of cattle were followed up. Fortnightly controls of the parasitaemia and PCV were carried out during 8 weeks. The main trypanosome species was Trypanosoma vivax (83.6%) followed by Trypanosoma congolense (16.4%). In two villages, less than 25% of the control untreated cattle became positive indicating no need to use prophylactic treatment. These two villages were not further studied. Resistance to ISM was observed in 5 of the remaining 8 villages (Debe, Bendougou, Kangotenga, Mou and Laro) where the relative risk (control/treated hazard ratios) of becoming infected was lower than 2 i.e. between 0.89 (95% Cl: 0.43-2.74) and 1.75 (95% CI: 0.57-5.37). In contrast, this study did not show evidence of resistance to DA in the surveyed villages with only 8.6% (n = 93) of the cattle relapsing after treatment. Our results suggest that because of the low prevalence of multiple resistances in the area a meticulous use of the sanative pair system would constitute the best option to delay as much as possible the spread of chemoresistance till complete eradication of the disease by vector control operations.

Prevalence of Leishmania infantum and co-infections in stray cats in northern Italy,"Stray cats in the city of Milan, Italy, were tested for Leishmania infantum and other selected infections. Twenty-seven cats (30.0%) were seroreactive by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), with an antibody titer of 1:40 for 16 (17.7%) cats and 1:80 (cut-off for feline L. infantum infection) for 11 (12.2%) cats. One blood (1.1%) and one popliteal lymph node (1.1%) sample tested positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction; no oculoconjunctival swabs tested positive. Feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, and feline coronavirus (FCoV) seroprevalence determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 6.1, 6.1, and 39.0%, respectively. Toxoplasma gondii, Bartonella henselae, and Chlamydophila felis prevalence determined by IFAT was 29.3,17.1, and 17.1%, respectively. The frequency of seroreactivity to L. infantum was significantly higher in FCoV-seropositive cats (OR = 4.4, P=0.04). L. infantum-infected stray cats in Milan have a high seropositivity rate, comparable to that of cats in areas endemic for leishmaniosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in Central Mozambique from 2002 to 2005,"The study is the result of analyzing 16895 blood smears of cattle collected at 180 sites in the provinces of Manica, Sofala, Zambezia and Tete in Mozambique. Of the blood smears 73.9% were from Manica, 11.8% from Tete, 8.5% from Sofala and 5.8% from Zambezia; 75.6% of these were collected from smallholder cattle. Infections with trypanosomes were highest in smallholder cattle from Sofala Province with 36.8% of the 872 blood smears examined positive for trypanosomes, and lowest in cattle of commercial farmers in Manica Province with only 6.2% of 2252 blood smears being positive. Trypanosoma congolense was the predominant species, followed by Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma brucei sensu lato. Trypanosoma brucei, which also infects humans, was more frequent in the districts of Buzi, Mutarara and Morrumbala with 15.1 %, 10.5% and 9.8% of all examined cattle in 2005 being infected with it, respectively. The results show a significant increase in the infection rate with trypanosomes compared with results obtained in previous years by the Regional Veterinary Laboratory in Manica Province and by the Regional Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Control Programme in Zambezia, Tete and Sofala provinces."
Diversity and evolution of anuran trypanosomes: insights from the study o European species,"Background: Amphibian trypanosomes were the first ever described trypanosomatids. Nevertheless, their taxonomy remains entangled because of pleomorphism and high prevalence of mixed infections. Despite the fact that the first species in this group were described in Europe, virtually none of the trypanosomes from European anurans was analyzed using modern molecular methods. Methods: In this study, we explored the diversity and phylogeny of trypanosomes in true frogs from Europe using light microscopy and molecular methods. Results: A comparison of observed morphotypes with previous descriptions allowed us to reliably identify three Totpanosorna spp., whereas the remaining two strains were considered to represent novel taxa. In all cases, more than one morphotype per blood sample was observed, indicating mixed infections. One hundred and thirty obtained 18S rRNA gene sequences were unambiguously subdivided into five groups, correspondent to the previously recognized or novel taxa of anuran trypanosomes. Conclusions: In this work we studied European frog trypanosomes. Even with a relatively moderate number of isolates, we were able to find not only three well-known species, but also two apparently new ones. We revealed that previous assignments of multiple isolates from distant geographical localities to one species based on superficial resemblance were unjustified. Our work also demonstrated a high prevalence of mixed trypanosome infections in frogs and proposed a plausible scenario of evolution of the genus Trypanosoma."
Species-specific diagnostics of Apis mellifera trypanosomatids: A nine-year survey (2007-2015) for trypanosomatids and microsporidians in Serbian honey bees,"In this study, honey bees collected in Serbia over 9 consecutive years (2007-2015) were retrospectively surveyed to determine the prevalence of eukaryotic gut parasites by molecular screening of archival DNA samples. We developed species-specific primers for PCR to detect the two known honey bee trypanosomatid species, Crithidia mellificae and the recently described Lotmaria passim. These primers were validated for target specificity under single and mixed-species conditions as well as against the bumblebee trypanosomatid Crithidia bombi. Infections by Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia) were also determined using PCR. Samples from 162 colonies (18 from each year) originating from 57 different localities were surveyed. L. passim was detected in every year with an overall frequency of 62.3% and annual frequencies ranging from 38.9% to 83.3%. This provides the earliest confirmed record to date for L. passim and the first report of this species in Serbia. N. ceranae was ubiquitous, occurring in every year and at 95.7% overall frequency, ranging annually from 83.3% to 100%. The majority of colonies (60.5%) were co-infected with L. passim and N. ceranae, but colony infections by each species were statistically independent of one another over the nine years. Although C. mellificae and N. apis have both been reported recently at low frequency in Europe, neither of these species was detected in Serbia. These results support the hypothesis that L. passim has predominated over C mellificae in A. mellifera during the past decade. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Bovine trypanosomiasis in tsetse-free pastoral zone of the Far-North region, Cameroon","Background & objectives: The Far-North region of Cameroon has been considered free of tsetse and trypanosomiasis for the past three decades. But recent reports by pastoralists indicate its reappearance in the region. This study was aimed to confirm the existence of cattle trypanosomiasis and determine its prevalence, and to establish pastoralists knowledge and practice (KP) of the disease in Ndiyam Shinwa pastoral zone of Cameroon. Methods: A total of 118 herds were surveyed for a descriptive, cross-sectional study in Ndiyam Shinwa pastoral zone from May to November 2014. Out of these, 110 herds were visited in the beginning of the rainy season, 22 of the 110 herds (suspect cattle) were revisited along with the remaining eight herds in the end of the season. The blood samples of 635 suspect cattle and 135 nonsuspect cattle were collected. Samples were subjected to two diagnostic tests: Buffy coat test (BCT) and packed cell volume (PCV) determination. A survey on pastoralist's (n = 118) KP about trypanosomiasis was also undertaken. Results: Parasitological analyses revealed six infections by Trypanosoma vivax: Four in suspect cattle against two in nonsuspect cattle, corresponding respectively to apparent prevalence of 0.63 and 1.46% and true prevalence of (0.79-3.15%) and (1.82-7.30%). The proportion of cattle found infected in the PCV as well as BCT tests was 33.26% for suspect cattle. More than 75% of followed-up suspects showed persisting symptoms nearly three months after initial examination. The most common diagnostic signs for pastoralists were ruffled hair, lacrimation, anorexia and emaciation. Interpretation & conclusion: Cattle trypanosomiasis has reappeared in the Far-North region and seems to be in the inter-epizootic phase. Pastoralists have a good knowledge of the disease, but their perception of its importance seems to be influenced by the persistence of symptoms attributed to this disease in suspect cattle."
Comparative seroprevalence and risk factor analysis of Trypanosoma evansi infection in equines from different agro-climatic zones of Punjab (India),"As parasitaemia is low and fluctuating during the chronic stage of infection, accurate detection of Trypanosoma evansi in blood is difficult. The primary aims of this investigation were to assess for the first time the seroprevalence of T evansi in all agro-climatic zones of Punjab, by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) and card agglutination test (CATT/T. evansi), and to evaluate the risk factors associated with latent trypanosomosis. A total of 319 equine serum samples collected from 12 districts of Punjab (India) belonging to different agro-climatic zones revealed 39 (12.23%) and 9 (2.82%) samples to be positive by CATT/T. evansi and iELISA, respectively. The highest prevalence was recorded from the Ludhiana district (42.86% and 7.14% by CATT/T. evansi and iELISA, respectively) in the central plain zone (for which the overall prevalence was 15% and 4.17%, respectively). There was fair agreement between the tests for the detection of T. evansi (kappa = 0.345). Species was the most influential risk factor for infection, with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.81 and 5.63 for donkeys/mules, in comparison with horses, by CATT/T. evansi and iELISA, respectively. The female equine population (OR = 3.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-7.67 [CATT]) was found to be at a higher risk of seropositivity for T. evansi, particularly on 'unorganised' (inappropriately managed) farms (OR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.53-6.65 [CATT]) and among animals used for commercial purposes (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.20-5.21 [CATT]). In conclusion, to declare disease-free status, use of the iELISA followed by retesting of suspect samples by CATT/T. evansi is suggested."
"Equine trypanosomosis in central and western Punjab: Prevalence, haemato-biochemical response and associated risk factors","The detection of Trypanosoma evansi in blood is intricate, primarily in chronic stage of infection, as the parasitaemia is often low and fluctuating. The climatic conditions of the target area of Punjab (a province of India with a total of 34,000 horses and ponies used for sports and transport) are conducive for the parasite propagation. The objective of present investigation was to assess the prevalence of T. evansi in central and western Punjab by PCR and card agglutination test (CATT/T. evansi) in relation to clinico-haematobiochemical alterations and risk factors associated with latent trypanosomosis. A total of 169 equine blood and serum samples tested by CATT/T. evansi revealed 16 cases positive, with 6.8% from central plain and 13.63% from western zone. To assess the specificity of serological test, PCR1 was performed using established primer pair TR3 5'-GCG CGG ATT CTT TGC AGA CGA-3' and TR4 5'-TGC AGA CAC TGG AAT GTT ACT-3' for T. evansi. PCR2 applied with primer pair RoTat1.2F: 5'-ATG TCA ACG ATG CCT GTT ACA TTA CGC AC-3' and RoTat1.2R:5'-TAA ATA TCA CTG TCA AGA CCT GCT GCG G-3' to rule out the consensus between the finding of the two PCR assays and agglutination test for T. evansi, which displayed results in concordance with PCR1. PCR assays showed 1.92 and 1.51% positive samples from central plain and western zone, respectively. With respect to PCR assay, CATT/T. evansi showed 100% sensitivity and 92.1% specificity. Microscopy showed a very low prevalence rate of 0.59% with only one sample positive with teaming parasitaemia. Comparison between sexes revealed higher positivity in mares by the three tests (BSE: 0.95%, PCR: 2.88%, CATT/T. evansi: 14.42%). The haemato-biochemical factors were found to be altered in PCR positive cases, while the mean value of vital parameters lied in normal range in seropositive cases. The female horse (RR = 0.0937, 95% CI = 1.388-190.223%) population was found to be at the highest risk of seropositivity for T. evansi, particularly in the unorganized farms (RR = 19.726, 95% CI = 2.918-400.221%).

"Prevalence of canine leishmaniasis in Beichuan County, Sichuan, China and phylogenetic evidence for an undescribed Leishmania sp in China based on 7SL RNA","Background: Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease, which is still endemic in the west and northwest area of China. Canines are the major reservoirs of Leishmania, the etiological agent of human visceral leishmaniasis. Phlebotomus chinensis is the main transmission vector of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL). Methods: In this study, rK39 dip-stick, ELISA and PCR methods were used to investigate the prevalence of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Beichuan County, Sichuan Province, China. Results: Among the 86 dogs which were included in the study, 13 dogs were positive using the dip-stick test (15.12%), while 8 dogs were positive using ELISA (9.30%) and 19 dogs were positive for PCR (22.03%). In total, 32 dogs were positive for one or more tests (37.21%). Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis based on the partial 7SL RNA fragment provided evidence that an undescribed Leishmania species, which is clearly a causative agent of CanL and human visceral leishmaniasis, does exist in China. This result is consistent with our previous study. Conclusions: Our work confirmed that canine leishmaniasis is still prevalent in Beichuan County. Further control is urgently needed, as canine leishmaniasis is of great public health importance. The phylogenetic analysis based on 7SL RNA segment provides evidence for the existence of an undescribed Leishmania sp. in China."
Trypanosomatids in ornithophilic bloodsucking Diptera,"Trypanosomes are known as widespread blood parasites of birds; however, knowledge of their prevalences in vectors and their overall biodiversity is rather limited. To assess the prevalences in potential vectors, we have microscopically examined ornithophilic bloodsucking Diptera (Culicidae, Simuliidae and Hippoboscidae) for the presence of trypanosomatids in their guts. In total, 3270 specimens were dissected, namely Culex pipiens Linnaeus, 1758 (n = 898), C. modestus Ficalbi, 1890 (136), Simulium vernum (Macquart, 1838) (1455), S. angustipes Edwards, 1915 (221) and Ornithomyia avicularia (Linnaeus, 1758) (560). All insect species were found to be infected with trypanosomatids, and the prevalence ranged from 4 to 8% but reached 60% in S. vernum. Blackflies and hippoboscids exclusively harboured trypanosomes (both T. cf. avium s.s. Danilewsky, 1885; T. corvi/culicavium group in hippoboscids). Mosquitoes were infected with T. culicavium Votypka, 2012 and T. avium s. l. but also with monoxenous parasites, namely Crithidia brevicula Frolov and Malysheva, 1989, and Paratrypanosoma confusum Votypka and Lukes, 2013. Only 4% of the isolated parasite strains were monoxenous whereas the majority were avian trypanosomes, confirming the vectorial status of the studied insects."
Trypanosomes and haemosporidia in the buzzard (Buteo buteo) and sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus): factors affecting the prevalence of parasites,"The prevalences of heteroxenous parasites are influenced by the interplay of three main actors: hosts, vectors, and the parasites themselves. We studied blood protists in the nesting populations of raptors in two different areas of the Czech Republic. Altogether, 788 nestlings and 258 adult Eurasian sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) and 321 nestlings and 86 adult common buzzards (Buteo buteo) were screened for parasites by the microscopic examination of blood smears and by cultivation. We examined the role of shared vectors and parasite phylogenetic relationships on the occurrence of parasites. In different years and hosts, trypanosome prevalence ranged between 1.9 and 87.2 %, that of Leucocytozoon between 1.9 and 100 %, and Haemoproteus between 0 and 72.7 %. Coinfections with Leucocytozoon and Trypanosoma, phylogenetically distant parasites but both transmitted by blackflies (Simuliidae), were more frequent than coinfections with Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus, phylogenetically closely related parasites transmitted by different vectors (blackflies and biting midges (Ceratopogonidae), respectively). For example, 16.6 % buzzard nestlings were coinfected with Trypanosoma and Leucocytozoon, while only 4.8 % with Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus and 0.3 % with Trypanosoma and Haemoproteus. Nestlings in the same nest tended to have the same infection status. Furthermore, prevalence increased with the age of nestlings and with Julian date, while brood size had only a weak negative/positive effect on prevalence at the individual/brood level. Prevalences in a particular avian host species also varied between study sites and years. All these factors should thus be considered while comparing prevalences from different studies, the impact of vectors being the most important. We conclude that phylogenetically unrelated parasites that share the same vectors tend to have similar distributions within the host populations of two different raptor species."

Vector-borne infections in cats: Molecular study in Barcelona area (Spain),"Previous serological surveys have reported the presence of different organisms in cats from Spain but little reports exist about the exact identity of these organisms. The purpose of the study reported here was to assess the presence of DNA of several vector-borne infections in a population of cats from Barcelona area. One hundred blood samples obtained from cats admitted to the UAB-VTH were entered into the study and classified as healthy (n = 48) or unhealthy (n = 52). EDTA-blood samples were assayed for Leishmania infantum, Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., Bartonella spp., Hepatozoon spp., Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. DNA by means of PCR amplification and amplicons obtained were sequenced. Prevalence of infectious agents found were Leishmania infantum (3%), Ehrlichia/Anaplasma sp. (M), Hepatozoon felis (4%) and Bartonella clarridgeiae (1%). Cats being less than 5 years old had more probability of having at less one PCR positive result (P = 0.028). The results of this study show a low prevalence of several vector-borne pathogens among cats from Barcelona area. Although higher feline seroprevalences are previously reported, they evidenced exposure and probably overestimate the real or active degree of infection. However, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion on these infectious diseases, both in sick and asymptomatic cats, and molecular techniques could aid in the identification of these pathogens.

"PCR survey of vectorborne pathogens in dogs living in and around Barcelona, an area endemic for leishmaniosis","Blood samples from 153 dogs living in and around Barcelona were assayed for Leishmania infantum and Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia, Bartonella, Hepatozoon, Babesia and Theileria species by PCR amplification of DNA, and the amplicons obtained were sequenced. The prevalence of the infectious agents was L infantum (29.4 per cent), Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species (4.0 per cent), Hepatozoon canis (3.3 per cent), Babesia canis vogeli (2.0 per cent), Babesia gibsoni (2.0 per cent), Babesia canis canis (1.3 per cent) and Theileria annae (0.7 per cent). Coinfections were present in seven of the dogs and they were significantly associated with L infantum infection (P=0.024). There was a significant correlation between clinical signs of illness and the load of L infantum."
Detection of Leishmania infantum by real-time PCR in a canine blood bank,"OBJECTIVES: Risk for transmission of Leishmania infantum from blood products has been largely demonstrated in human and veterinary literature. Appropriate screening of canine blood donors is important especially in an endemic area such as Barcelona (Spain). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of L infantum DNA parasites by real-time quantitative PCR in our canine blood bank. METHODS: Samples from blood products obtained from 92 canine blood donors were assayed for L infantum by means of real-time PCR amplification and quantification. RESULTS: The prevalence of quantitative PCR-positive blood samples among healthy seronegative blood donors was 19.6 per cent. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:The results of this study show that L infantum infection is common in canine blood donors and their blood products in an endemic area, despite a negative commercial serological screening for infectious diseases. Therefore, screening by PCR should be included in an integrated approach to evaluate L infantum infection among potential blood donors."
"Bovine trypanosomosis and its vectors in two districts of Bench Maji zone, South Western Ethiopia","A cross-sectional study was carried out from November 2008 to February 2009 in Guraferda and Sheko districts of Bench Maji Zone, South Western Ethiopia. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis and the density of its vectors. An overall prevalence of trypanosome infection in the study area was 4.4%. Trypanosoma congolense (36.36%) was the dominant trypanosome species followed by Trypanosoma vivax (18.18%) and Trypanosoma brucei (9.09%). Mean packed cell volume value of parasitemic animals (21.8%) was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of aparasitemic animals (27.7%). Biconical and NGU traps were deployed for 72 h, and the result indicated Glossina pallidipes followed by Glossina fuscipes as the only tsetse fly species caught in the study area along with other biting flies like Stomoxys and Tabanus. The apparent density of tsetse flies was 2.83 flies trap(-1) day(-1). NGU trap caught more of G. pallidipes while biconical trap caught more G. fuscipes, and the difference was significant (P < 0.05). Although the current study indicated low prevalence of trypanosomosis in the study area, the impacts of trypanosomosis on cattle production and productivity should not be neglected. Therefore, attention should be given to control the disease and also the vector."
"Prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis and its vectors in two districts of East Wollega Zone, Ethiopia","Trypanosomosis is a parasitic disease that causes serious economic losses in livestock, especially in sub-Saharan countries. This study was conducted from October 2010 to March 2011 in the Diga and Sasiga districts of the East Wollega zone in western Ethiopia to determine the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis and its vectors. A total of 386 blood samples were collected from randomly selected animals. Packed cell volume (PCV) was determined and samples were examined for the presence of trypanosomes using the buffy coat technique. Out of 386 blood samples, 8.55% tested positive for trypanosomes. The majority of the infections were caused by Trypanosoma congolense (72.73%), followed by Trypanosoma vivax (27.27%). There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between districts, altitudes, sexes and ages, but the prevalence was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in cattle which were in poor body condition. The mean PCV value of infected animals (21.45 +/- 3.62 s.d.) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of non-infected animals (26.60 +/- 4.60 s.d.). A total of 1151 flies were caught by deploying 21 monoconical shaped traps. Of these flies, 822 (71.42%) were Glossina, whilst the remaining flies were either Stomoxys (17.20%) or Tabanus (11.38%). The overall apparent densities of tsetse and biting flies were 1.45 and 0.58 flies per trap per day, respectively. In conclusion, this study confirmed that trypanosomes and their vectors are prevalent and still pose a threat to cattle production in the area. Therefore, proper strategies have to be designed and implemented to minimise their effect on livestock production."
Prevalence of Sodalis glossinidius and different trypanosome species in Glossina palpalis palpalis caught in the Fontem sleeping sickness focus of the southern Cameroon,"Tsetse flies are the cyclical vector of human and animal African trypanosomiasis. To improve vector control in order to achieve the elimination of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and boost the control of animal diseases, investigations have been undertaken on the tripartite association between tsetse, trypanosome, and symbionts. It is in this light that Sodalis glossinidius and different trypanosomes were identified in Glossina palpalis palpalis caught in Fontem in southern Cameroon. For this study, DNA was extracted from whole flies, and S. glossinidius and different trypanosome species were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Statistical analyses were performed to compare the trypanosome and S. glossinidius infection rates and to look for an association between these microorganisms. Of the 274 G. p. palpalis caught, 3.3% (9/274) were teneral. About 35% (96/274) of these flies harbored S. glossinidius. Of the 265 non-teneral flies, 37.7% were infected by trypanosomes. The infection rates of Trypanosoma congolense ""forest type'' and Trypanosoma vivax were 26.04% and 18.11%, respectively. About 6.41% of tsetse harbored mixed infections of T. congolense and T. vivax. Of the 69 tsetse with T. congolense infections, 33.33% (23/69) harbored S. glossinidius while 71.86% (69/96) of flies harboring S. glossinidius were not infected by trypanosomes. No association was observed between S. glossinidius and trypanosome infections. Some wild tsetse harbor S. glossinidius and trypanosomes, while others have no infection or are infected by only one of these microorganisms. We conclude that the presence of S. glossinidius does not favor trypanosome infections in G. p. palpalis of the Fontem focus."
Molecular survey of pathogenic trypanosomes in naturally infected Nigerian cattle,"Microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to survey pathogenic trypanosome infection in naturally infected Nigerian cattle. In 411 animals sampled, microscopy detected 15.1% positive infection of at least one of Trypanosoma brucei, Tiypanosoma congolense or Trypanosoma vivax, while PCR detected 63.7% positive infections of at least one of those species and Tiypanosoma evansi. PCR detected 4.4%, 48.7%, 26.0% and 0.5% respectively of T. brucei, T. congolense, T. vivax and T. evansi infections. All of the T. congolense detected were savannah-type, except for two forest-type infections. Prevalence of mixed infections was 13.9%, being primarily co-infection by T. congolense and T. vivax while prevalence of mixed infections by T. evansi, T. vivax and T. congolense was 1.5%. Microscopy showed poor sensitivity but specificity greater than 94%. Infection rates were much higher in Southern than in Northern Nigeria. Infections were lowest in N'dama compared to Muturu, Sokoto Gudali and White Fulani breeds. Animals with T. vivax monoinfection and mixed infections showed significantly lower packed cell volume (PCV) values. Those infected with any Trypanosoma species with <200 parasites/mu l showed higher PCV values than those infected with >200 parasites/mu l. The new finding of savannah- and forest- type T. congolense in Nigeria and the relatively high abundance of mixed infections are of significant clinical relevance. This study also suggests that T. congolense is the most prevalent species in Nigeria. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Presence of Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and Pic (Triatoma dimidiata) infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in urban areas: preliminary evaluation in the city of Campeche, Mexico","The aim of this study was to identify the infection prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi in opossums and triatomines captured in urban areas of Campeche City, Mexico. We collected 25 specimens of marsupials of Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) species showing a T. cruzi infection prevalence of 52% (13/25). Also, 36 specimens of Pic (Triatoma dimiata) vectors were collected, showing a T. cruzi infection prevalence of 41.6% (15/36). All T. cruzi isolates were TcI, which correspond to the predominant lineage in mammals of Mexico, irrespective of the mammalian host species or vector."
First Record of Autochthonous Canine Leishmaniasis in Hungary,"Hungary is traditionally regarded as a leishmaniasis-free country, and human or canine cases diagnosed locally have been recorded as imported. However, recent entomological surveys have verified the presence in Hungary of Phlebotomus neglectus and Phlebotomus perfiliewi perfiliewi, which have been incriminated as competent vectors of Leishmania infantum elsewhere in Europe. Following the occurrence in October 2007 of an undisputable clinical case of L. infantum canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in a 4-year-old female pug in a kennel of 20 dogs in Tolna province, an investigation was performed to assess the infection status in that canine population and to search for putative phlebotomine vectors. Another female pug became sick during the study period (May-November 2008) and L. infantum was confirmed as the causative agent. The other animals appeared clinically healthy; however, 4 additional dogs were found positive by indirect fluorescent antibody test (2 dogs), or by buffy-coat PCR (1 dog), or by both methods (1 dog). Hence the overall Leishmania infection prevalence in the kennel was 30% (6/20). All dogs were born in the same place and had been always kept outdoors. They had neither been abroad nor received a blood transfusion. No sand flies were collected with CDC Standard Miniature Light traps, Mosquito Magnet (R) X (MMX) dry ice-baited traps, or sticky traps placed either in or around the kennel and at nearby chicken yards during July and August of 2008 and 2009. Considering the dogs' historical background and the failure to trap any sand fly vectors in the kennel area, the origin of CanL in this site remains unexplained."
"Trypanosoma avium incidence, pathogenicity and response to melarsomine in falcons from Kuwait","Epidemiological and clinical studies on Trypanosoma avium ore lacking in the Middle East. The aims of this study were to determine the T. avium incidence in falcons from Kuwait, report clinical signs and find an effective therapy. Blood smears from 92 1 diseased and 56 healthy falcons were examined between May 2003 and April 2004. 12 birds (1.3%) were found infected by T. avium and ten of these were treated with melarsomine (Cymelarson((R))) at a dosage of 0.25 mg/kg intramuscularly for four days. All affected birds presented clinical signs, including incapacity of flying high, poor appetite, lethargy, loosing weight, weakness, dyspnoea and death. Signs disappeared within 1-7 days after administration of melarsomine. Trypomastigotes were not detected in blood smears made 1-7 days after the end of therapy. This study suggests that T. avium induces disease in falcons and that melarsomine can be an effective therapy eliminating both clinical signs and circulating trypomastigotes."
"Cattle anaemia and trypanosomiasis in western Oromia State, Ethiopia","Trypanosomiasis via causing anaemia, emaciation and death is the top constraint to livestock production in Africa, and its incidence in western Oromia (an endemic area for tsetse flies) is unknown. A total of 1132 cattle from 3 tsetse infected Districts (599 in Dale Sadi, 161 in Dale Wobara and 372 in Hawa Galan) were investigated for determining anaemia (haematocrite below 24%) and trypanosome infections via buffy coat microscopic examination. The overall anaemia prevalence was 39.1% and was more frequent in Dale Wobara and Dale Sadi districts. Animals with poor or medium body condition as well as adult and old females significantly exhibited more often anaemic status. The overall Trypanosome infection prevalence was 8.57% (97/1132) in Western Oromia and was essentially due to T. congolense alone (82 cases) in the 3 districts or associated with T. vivax in the Dale Sadi district only (3 cases). No significant association with sex, age or body condition was detected. Globally, the mean haematocrite value was significantly depressed in infected cattle and anaemia more frequently occurred in the infected animals, particularly with T. congolense, than in the not infected ones in western Oromia and in Dale Sadi and Hawa Galan districts. Nevertheless, the proportion of non anaemic infected animals remained elevated (46/97) and trypanosomes were not detected in the majority of anaemic cattle (88.5%) indicating that the infection was not systematically associated to anaemia and suggesting the occurrence of other causes of anaemia in this endemic area."
Rodent-borne Trypanosoma from cities and villages of Niger and Nigeria: A special role for the invasive genus Rattus?,"Although they are known to sometimes infect humans, atypical trypanosomes are very poorly documented, especially in Africa where one lethal case has yet been described. Here we conducted a survey of rodent-borne Trypanosoma in 19 towns and villages of Niger and Nigeria, with a special emphasis on Niamey, the capital city of Niger. The 1298 rodents that were captured yielded 189 qPCR-positive animals from 14 localities, thus corresponding to a 14.6% overall prevalence. Rats, especially black rats, displayed particularly elevated prevalence (27.4%), with some well sampled sites showing 40-50% and up to 68.8% of Trypanosoma-carrying individuals. Rattus were also characterized by significantly lower Ct values than in the other non-Rattus species. DNA sequences could be obtained for 43 rodent-borne Trypanosoma and corresponded to 41 T. lewisi (all from Rattus) and 2 T. microti (from Cricetomys gambianus). These results, together with data compiled from the available literature, suggest that Rattus may play a particular role for the maintaining and circulation of Trypanosoma, especially T. lewisi, in Africa. Taken into account its strong abilities to invade coastal and inland regions of the continent, we believe that this genus deserves a particular attention in regards to potentially under-looked but emerging atypical trypanosome-related diseases."
"Cattle breeding, trypanosomosis prevalence and drug resistance in Northern Togo","African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT) is a major disease of cattle in Togo and its control is essentially based on chemotherapy. However, because of excessive use of trypanocides during the past decades, chemo-resistance in the parasites has developed. In order to assess the current situation of AAT and resistance to trypanocidal drugs in Northern Togo, a study was conducted on cattle from December 2012 to August 2013 in the regions of Kara and Savanes. An initial cross-sectional survey was carried out in 40 villages using the Haematocrit Centrifugation Technique (HCT). Out of these, 5 villages with a trypanosome prevalence of >10% were selected for a block treatment study (BT) with diminazene diaceturate (DA: 3.5 mg/kg for a 14-day follow-up) and isometamidium chloride (ISM: 0.5 mg/kg for a 28-day follow-up). Positive blood samples collected during the parasitological surveys and an equivalent number of negatives were further analyzed by PCR-RFLP for trypanosome species confirmation and molecular diagnosis of resistance to DA in Trypanosoma congolense. The results from 1883 bovine blood samples confirmed a high overall trypanosome prevalence of 10.8% in Northern Togo. PCR-RFLP revealed that T. congolense is the dominant pathogenic trypanosome species (50.5%) followed by T. vivax (27.3%), and T. brucei (16.2%). The BT showed varying levels of treatment failures ranging from 0 to 30% and from 0 to 50% for DA and for ISM respectively, suggesting the existence of resistant trypanosome populations in the study area. Our results show that AAT still represents a major obstacle to the development of cattle husbandry in Northern Togo. In areas of high AAT risk, a community-based integrated strategy combining vector control, rational use of trypanocidal drugs and improving the general condition of the animals is recommended to decision makers.

"Field investigation of Trypanosoma evansi and comparative analysis of diagnostic tests in horses from Bahawalpur, Pakistan","In order to assess the prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi, a parasitological, molecular, and serological-based investigation was carried out in randomly sampled horses (n = 375) belonging to different age groups, sexes, and localities from the district of Bahawalpur, Pakistan. The diagnostic performance of applied tests was also compared. The prevalence was recorded as 0.5% with Woo's test, 1.3% with both ITS CF/BR PCR and RoTat 1.2 PCR, and 14.4% with CATT/T. evansi. Based on CATT/T. evansi, significant differences (P <= 0.05) were observed for prevalence estimates according to different localities, sexes, body condition scores, and origins. A nonsignificant difference (P >= 0.05) was observed among different age groups and variable parity numbers. Our study declares district Bahawalpur to be a high risk area for surra and proposes the potential use of CATT/T. evansi as a field test of choice for surveys in horses. However, the status of seropositive animals should be confirmed using a more sensitive molecular tool such as the satellite DNA target. A widespread status of anti-Trypanosoma antibodies calls for control measures and further investigation of various species (camels, cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes) inhabiting the same area to identify reservoir status."
"Parasitological, serological and molecular survey of Trypanosoma evansi infection in dromedary camels from Cholistan Desert, Pakistan","Background: Surra, a vector borne disease caused by Trypanosoma (T.) evansi, affects the health, productivity and working capacity of camels. Since clinical signs are not pathognomonic, diagnosis must be confirmed by laboratory methods. This is a first study on the prevalence of surra in Cholistan Desert, Pakistan using a broad variety of diagnostic tests thereby emphasizing it as a risk for the dromedaries of Pakistan. Methods: In a cross sectional study, 1005 dromedary camels from three districts in the Cholistan Desert were sampled to assess the prevalence of trypanosomosis due to T. evansi by means of parasitological (Giemsa stained thin smear), serological (formol gel test, CATT/T. evansi, ELISA/VSG RoTat 1.2, immune trypanolysis) and molecular tests (TBR1/2 PCR and RoTat 1.2 PCR). Kappa was calculated to assess the degree of agreement between different tests whereas chi-square test along with odds ratios and their 95 % confidence intervals were used to study influence of breed, gender, age and locality on disease prevalence. Results: Overall prevalence was 0.7 % with Giemsa stained thin smears (GST), 40.1 % with formol gel test (FGT), 47.7 % with CATT/T. evansi, 44.2 % with ELISA/VSG RoTat 1.2, 39.9 % with immune trypanolysis (TL), 31.9 % with TBR1/2 PCR and 30.5 % with RoTat1.2 PCR. Based on these results, the Cholistan Desert appears to be a high risk area for surra. According to TL and TBR1/2 PCR, camels at Bahawalpur are approximately two times more likely to be infected than those in Bahawalnagar (OR = 1.8; 95 % CI: 1.38-2.42) and Rahim Yar Khan (OR = 1.9; 95 % CI: 1.30-2.75). Test agreement of TL was moderate with CATT/T. evansi (k = 0.43; 95 % CI: 0.378-0.489) and ELISA/VSG RoTat 1.2 (k = 0.54; 95 % CI: 0.489-0.594) and poor with the other tests. Test agreement between TBR1/2 PCR and RoTat1.2 PCR was almost perfect (k = 0.96; 95 % CI: 0.950-0.984). We didn't find evidence for the presence of T. evansi type B in the studied population. Conclusion: Our study supports using antibody detection tests, rather than parasitological and molecular examination, to assess surra prevalence in camels. It also calls for implementation of measures to control surra in the Cholistan Desert."
Emerging Chagas disease: Trophic network and cycle of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi from palm trees in the Amazon,"A trophic network involving molds, invertebrates, and vertebrates, ancestrally adapted to the palm tree (Attalaea phalerata) microhabitat, maintains enzootic Trypanosoma cruzi infections in the Amazonian county Paco do Lumiar, state of Maranhao, Brazil. We assessed seropositivity for T. cruzi infections in the human population of the county, searched in palm trees for the triatomines that harbor these infections, and gathered demographic, environmental, and socioeconomic data. Rhodnius pictipes and R. neglectus in palm-tree frond clefts or in houses were infected with T. cruzi (57% and 41%, respectively). Human blood was found in 6.8% of R. pictipes in houses, and 9 of 10 wild Didelphis marsupialis had virulent T. cruzi infections. Increasing human population density, rain forest deforestation, and human predation of local fauna are risk factors for human T. cruzi infections."
"Seroepidemiology of Leishmania infantum in dogs in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Leishmaniosis are zoonoses that present several clinical manifestations in humans and have dogs as their main reservoir in the urban environment. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe form of the parasitosis and has been increasing in Brazil, despite the actions of public health agencies. Until 2002, the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) was considered free of human and canine leishmaniasis. The first human case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in RS was recorded in 2003. In 2009, the first autochthonous cases of human VL and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) were confirmed in Sao Borja, RS, and the occurrence of the insect vector was recorded for the first time in the state. In 2010, the first confirmed case of CVL was reported and seropositive dogs were identified in the city of Porto Alegre, RS. Given the importance of this zoonosis and the difficulties of a reliable diagnosis in dogs, this study aimed to identify epidemiological aspects of CVL in dogs in an area of Porto Alegre where cases of the disease have been reported. A total of 300 blood samples were collected from dogs in this area, which were then tested by the methods of RT-DPP (R) and ELISA for diagnosis of Leishmania infantum. An epidemiological questionnaire was completed by dog owners, containing aspects related to care of the animals, characteristics of their environment, and their living conditions. We observed that 83% (250/300) of the studied dogs were of mixed breed, 58% (175/300) were female, 78% (238/300) slept outdoors, and 61% (183/300) shared their living quarters with other species. Clinically, we observed that 90% (270/300) of the animals were infested by ectoparasites, 70% (210/300) had dermatopathies, 24% (72/300) presented weight loss and anorexia, and 22% (65/300) had ocular disorders. The results of the two serological tests were 100% concordant for the three seropositive samples (1%), and the remaining 297 (99%) were negative for both tests. We conclude that despite the low prevalence of L. infantum seropositive dogs, conditions in the region are favorable for CVL transmission, creating a risk of VL for the human population in the city of Porto Alegre."
Phlebotomine sandfly (Diptera: Psychodidae) diversity and their Leishmania DNA in a hot spot of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis human cases along the Brazilian border with Peru and Bolivia,"In this study, we identified the phlebotomine sandfly vectors involved in the transmission of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) in Assis Brasil, Acre, Brazil, which is located on the Brazil-Peru-Bolivia frontier. The genotyping of Leishmania in phlebotomines was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. A total of 6,850 sandflies comprising 67 species were captured by using CDC light traps in rural areas of the municipality. Three sandfly species were found in the state of Acre for the first time: Lutzomyia georgii, Lu. complexa and Lu. evangelistai. The predominant species was Lu. auraensis/Lu. ruifreitasi and Lu. davisi (total 59.27%). 32 of 368 pools were positive for the presence of Leishmania DNA (16 pools corresponding to Lu. davisi, and 16 corresponding to Lu. auraensis/Lu. ruifreitasi), with a minimal infection prevalence of 1.85% in Lu. davisi and 2.05% in Lu. auraensis/Lu. ruifreitasi. The Leishmania species found showed maximum identity with L. (Viannia) guyanensis and L. (V.) braziliensis in both phlebotomine species. Based on these results and similar scenarios previously described along the Brazil/Peru/Bolivia tri-border, the studied area must take into consideration the possibility of Lu. davisi and Lu. auraensis/Lu. ruifreitasi as probable vectors of ACL in this municipality."
HEMOPARASITES OF RACCOONS (PROCYON-LOTOR) IN FLORIDA,"Four hemoparasite species (Babesia lotori, Trypanosoma cruzi, Dirofilaria tenuis and Mansonella llewellyni) were found in raccoons (Procyon lotor) collected from 1972 to 1974 in Duval (n = 14) and Collier (n = 170) counties, Florida (USA). Trypanosoma cruzi was found in thin blood smears from one raccoon at each locality. The prevalence of B. lotori was 79% and 80% in samples taken in December 1973 in Collier and Duval counties, respectively. No patent infections by B. lotori were detected in raccoons collected in Collier County in December 1972, but 42% of the raccoons examined in September 1973 were infected. In Collier County there were no significant differences in the prevalence of B. lotori by host sex or age. In Duval County, overall D. tenuis prevalence was 7%, whereas that of M. llewellyni was 14%; the latter species was not found in Collier County. Adult raccoons had a significantly greater prevalence of D. tenuis (32%) than did sub-adults and juveniles (7%), and male raccoons showed a significantly greater prevalence (51%) than did females (8%)."
"Phenotypic characteristics and trypanosome prevalence of Mursi cattle breed in the Bodi and Mursi districts of South Omo Zone, southwest Ethiopia","The study was conducted to characterize the morphological features of Mursi cattle breed and to identify the species of trypanosome infecting the cattle and its prevalence in these traditionally managed cattle in the Bodi and Mursi pastoral communities. Cattle body description and measurements were made on 201 matured animals. Blood samples were collected from 409 animals into heparin-treated capillary tubes and were centrifuged to 12,000 rpm for 5 min to identify trypanosome species from the wet smeared buffy coat and to estimate the degree of anemia (PCV). Tsetse flies were collected using phenol-treated biconical trap and the caught flies identified to species level. The breed possesses variable coat color pattern, coat color type, and have small to medium hump size on the thoracic vertebrae. Body measurement of Mursi cattle in the two locations did not show significant differences except chest girth, rump width, and horn length. Trypanosome prevalence in the Mursi cattle breed was 6.1 %. The highest trypanosome infection was caused by Trypanosoma congolense (56 %) followed by Trypanosoma vivax (40 %) and Trypanosoma brucei (4 %). Trypanosome prevalence significantly varies between dry (2.0 %) and late rainy (10.1 %) seasons (P < 0.001) and between lean (11.9 %) and medium (2.4 %) body condition score (P < 0.01). The PCV value was 22.1 +/- 0.5 %, which is significantly varied with season (P < 0.01) and parasitism (P < 0.001). Parasitaemic cattle show the lowest PCV value (20.4 +/- 1%) than aparasitaemic (23.7 +/- 0.3 %) cattle and cattle with lean BCS showed the lowest (P < 0.0001) PCV value (20.4 +/- 0.6 %). Tsetse fly species identified in the study area were Glossina pallidipes, Glossina morsitans submorsitans, and Glossina fuscipes. The number of flies captured in late rainy season was higher than in dry season (P < 0.01). Despite the existence of trypanosome and high tsetse fly infestation in the areas, large proportion of the Mursi cattle shows medium BCS, low trypanosome prevalence, and higher PCV value."
"Phlebotomine sandfly fauna and natural Leishmania infection rates in a rural area of Cerrado (tropical savannah) in Nova Mutum, State of Mato Grosso in Brazil","Introduction: American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) has been reported in every municipality of the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, but the transmission epidemiology remains poorly understood. Our study was developed in a rural area of the Nova Mutum municipality where four autochthonous cases of ACL were reported in 2009. Our aims were to describe the local phlebotomine sandfly fauna and to investigate the infection rates and infecting Leishmania species in the captured sandflies. Methods: Entomological captures were performed bimonthly at 10 fixed sites close to the edge of a forested area between June 2011 and April 2012. Results: A total of 3,743 phlebotomine sandflies belonging to 31 distinct species were captured. Approximately 75% of the specimens were females. The most abundant species (45.4%) was Lutzomyia antunesi, which was consistently captured at every site. Species that are epidemiologically important for ACL, such as L. flaviscutellata, L. whitmani and L. umbratilis, were also captured. L. antunesi and L. ubiquitalis were naturally infected by Leishmania braziliensis or Le. guyanensis, with minimum infection rates of 0.88% and 6.67%, respectively. Surprisingly, L. antunesi was infected by Le. infantum (synonym chagasi). Conclusions: The natural infection of L. antunesi and L. ubiquitalis by Leishmania sp. suggests that these species might play a role in the zoonotic cycle of ACL in Nova Mutum. The presence of Le. infantum in L. antunesi suggests that there may be a risk of an outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Nova Mutum."
"Allochthonous cases of canine visceral leishmaniasis in Parana, Brazil: epidemiological implications","The south region is the only area in Brazil that does not present autochthonous cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), however, in the state of Parana, dogs and humans have been found showing a VL compatible clinical profile. In view of this problem, the present work aimed at isolating and identifying the parasite and determining the cases autochthony. All animals clinically suspect of VL were clinically evaluated, and had samples of their blood collected for hemoculture (NNN culture medium), serology, PCR and RAPD-PCR, hemogram, and biochemical assays. The dogs presenting VL clinical profile had their lymph nodes and/or bone marrow punctured and their content inoculated in NNN culture medium. The protozoan isolated was identified by PCR and PCR-RAPD. Strains of Leishmania were isolated in 19 out of the 24 studied animals. Fourteen isolates were identified as L. (Leishmania) infantum, and five were L. (Viannia) braziliensis. In the epidemiological analysis, it was possible to determine that all dogs with L. (L.) infantum being allochthonous cases. Leishmaniasis is a zoonose that has the domestic dog as reservoir, the migration of such animals can disseminate the parasite to other regions, provided the agent finds an adequate ecotope and a specific vector (Lutzomyia longipalpis)."
"Prevalence of Sand Flies and Leishmania donovani Infection in a Natural Population of Female Phlebotomus argentipes in Bihar State, India","Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease, and in the Indian subcontinent the female Phlebotomus argentipes is the vector for Leishmania donovani. However, data on the extent of sand fly infection rates in natural settings using molecular methods have not been extensively reported in India. In this study a PCR technique was applied targeting the 18S rRNA encoding region to determine the prevalence of Leishmania infection in female P. argentipes captured in the field. For this study, sand flies were collected from 897 houses selected from 50 villages endemic for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Muzaffarpur district, Bihar state, using CDC miniature light traps and mouth aspirators. A total of 14,585 sand flies were collected of which 449 were female P. argentipes divided into 132 pools. Molecular detection using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene was carried out for the identification of P. argentipes and Leishmania. The overall prevalence of infection was 4.90-17.37% for L. donovani in female P. argentipes in endemic regions of Bihar state. In this study no correlation was found between the presence of infected sand flies and the occurrence of clinical VL. This study provides the first report evaluating the prevalence of Leishmania infection in sand flies in a region endemic for VL in India. Sergentomyia species are the most common species of sand fly. Knowledge of the infection rate in female P. argentipes may help in predicting severity of disease and in vector elimination programs."

"Probing Mixed-Genotype Infections II: High Multiplicity in Natural Infections of the Trypanosomatid, Crithidia bombi, in Its Host, Bombus spp","Mixed-genotype infections have major consequences for many essential elements of host-parasite interactions. With genetic exchange between co-infecting parasite genotypes increased diversity among parasite offspring and the emergence of novel genotypes from infected hosts is possible. We here investigated mixed-genotype infections using the host, Bombus spp. and its trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi as our study case. The natural infections of C. bombi were genotyped with a novel method for a representative sample of workers and spring queens in Switzerland. We found that around 60% of all infected hosts showed mixed-genotype infections with an average of 2.47 +/- 0.22 (S.E.) and 3.65 +/- 1.02 genotypes per worker or queen, respectively. Queens, however, harboured up to 29 different genotypes. Based on the genotypes of co-infecting strains, these could be putatively assigned to either 'primary' and 'derived' genotypes - the latter resulting from genetic exchange among the primary genotypes. High genetic relatedness among co-infecting derived but not primary genotypes supported this scenario. Co-infection in queens seems to be a major driver for the diversity of genotypes circulating in host populations.Citation: Tognazzo M, Schmid-Hempel R, Schmid-Hempel P (2012) Probing Mixed-Genotype Infections II: High Multiplicity in Natural Infections of the Trypanosomatid, Crithidia bombi, in Its Host, Bombus spp. PLoS ONE 7(11): e49137. doi:10.1371/journal.pone. 0049137"
"First report of natural infection in hedgehogs with Leishmania major, a possible reservoir of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in Algeria","We report here the first known cases of natural infection of hedgehogs with Leishmania major. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an important public health problem in the area of M'sila, a semi-arid province in Algeria's northern Sahara, where two species of hedgehog live, Atelerix algirus and Paraechinus aethiopicus. The aim of this research was to survey Leishmania infection in these hedgehogs and evaluate whether they were reservoir hosts of Leishmania in an endemic zoonotic focus of leishmaniasis. Serological and molecular methods were used to determine the presence of Leishmania in 24 hedgehogs caught directly by hand and identified at species level as 19 A. algirus and 5 P. aethiopicus. Specific anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected in 29.2% of individuals by Western blot and in 26.3% by ELISA. The real-time PCR performed in spleen, ear and blood samples detected Leishmania spp. DNA in 12.5% of the individuals, one A. algirus and two P. aethiopicus. Three skin and two spleen samples of these animals were found to be parasitized and were identified by molecular test as L. major. Considering our results, it is suggested that hedgehogs have a potential epidemiological role as reservoir hosts of L major. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Active surveillance of canine visceral leishmaniasis and american trypanossomiasis in rural dogs from non endemic area,"The canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) and american trypanosomiasis are important zoonoses in public health and dogs are the main domestic reservoir of the parasite for humans. The goal of this study was to estimate the prevalence of circulating antibodies anti- Trypanosoma cruzi and anti-Leishmania sp. in sera of dogs from the rural area of Botucatu, SP, Brazil. During the annual vaccination campaign against canine rabies in rural area, 689 blood samples were taken and processed by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test. The serological tests revealed the absence of antibodies anti-Leishmania spp., but anti- T cruzi antibodies were detected in 3 (0.4%) dogs."
Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis infection in wild small mammals in ecotourism area of Brazil,"Leishmaniases are parasitic diseases transmitted to mammalian hosts by sand fly vectors (Diptera: Psychodidae). Despite the increasing occurrence of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in urban centers, their transmission still occur primarily in wild environments and may be associated with professional activities and recreation, such as ecotourism. The Reserva Particular do Patrimo A nio Natural Santua A rio do Carac E a (RPPNSC) is one of the largest ecotourism attractions in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and comprises an area of environmental preservation with 11,233 hectares presenting a transitional vegetation between Cerrado and Atlantic Forest. The present study describes the abundance of small mammals in RPPNSC, the isolation and identification of Leishmania in five wild animals. Small mammals were bimonthly trapped along 6 trails within the RPPNSC with 10 Tomahawk traps each. Two trails were located in peridomiciliary areas near tourist lodging facilities, and four trails were located at sites visited by tourists in forest areas. The most prevalent species were Akodon cursor, Cerradomys subflavus and Oligoryzomys nigripes. Six isolates of Leishmania were obtained from these animals and identified as Leishmania braziliensis through HSP70-PCR RFLP method. Leishmania spp. DNA was detected by kDNA-PCR method and isolated by biphasic culture. Studies point to some of the captured species as potential wild reservoirs of Leishmania, suggesting they may be involved in the transmission cycle in these wild environments."

"PRESENCE OF TRYPANOSOME SPECIES AND ANEMIC STATUS OF DOGS IN ZURU, NIGERIA","The aim of this research is to study the presence and prevalence of trypanosome species in local dogs between January and July, 2010 in the Zuru area of Kebbi State, Nigeria. Standard trypanosome detection methods comprising of wet blood films, thin films and microhaematocrit centrifugation technique were used to detect trypanosomes; while the degree of anemia was determined through the use of FAMACHA (R) eye colour chart and packed cell volume values. A total of 567 dogs were enumerated in fourteen locations within the study area out of which 192 (33.7%) were randomly examined and 4 (2.08%) were positive for the presence of trypanosomes. All positive samples morphologically belong to the Trypanosoma brucei group. The obtained PCV values showed that 50 (26.04%) dogs were anemic, while the FAMACHA (R) detected anemia status of varying degrees in 104 (77%) sampled dogs. These findings are significant as this is the first time that the trypanosome infection will be reported in dogs from the study area. This study establishes the presence of Trypanosoma brucei group in the study area, which is of zoonotic and economic importance."
Chagas seroepidemiology in school children of Jujuy,"Chagas disease constitutes the main zoonosis in the province of Jujuy, Argentina, where it is one of the most important issues in public health. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the results of a serologic evaluation carried out for a seven-year period among schoolchildren in the Jujenean capital city. The population under study consisted of all seventh grade students of all schools in San Salvador de Jujuy. They were classified into three socioeconomic levels: High, Medium and Low levels. Indirect hemagglutination and immunofluorescence tests were performed. Percentages of seroprevalence were determined by sex, age group, and socioeconomic level. To analyze and check results, the following tests were applied: ANOVA, Tukey's and chi-square test. General prevalence was 1.95% with inter-annual statistically non-significant variations. Statistically significant variations were found among: 1) sex, where the feminine sex exhibited higher seroprevalence; 2) age groups, in which 12-year-olds showed higher seroprevalence; 3) socioeconomic levels, where seroprevalence increased as socioeconomic level decreased. Chagasic seroprevalence in children populations is an indicator that allows assessing both transmission risks in the community and the efficiency of preventive measures to control the vector. Data resulting from this study would indicate: 1) an adequate control both of non-vectorial transmission as well as of the vector, since no temporal variation was recorded in seroprevalence in the age-group analyzed; 2) higher seroprevalence in children belonging to a lower socioeconomic level, probably due to migrations of already-infected mothers coming from neighboring endemic, less epidemiologically controlled areas."

"Serological and entomological survey of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in Denizli Province, Aegean Region, Turkey","A cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey of leishmaniasis was carried out among children and adults from four villages and one district of Denizli province located in the Southern Aegean Region of Turkey where 14 human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) cases including 4 adults Were reported between 1993 and 2000. Blood samples were taken from 329 children, 217 adults and 140 dogs and a physical examination was also done. Indirect fluorescent antibody test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were performed for all sera. All 329 sera collected from children were found to be negative while 2 (0.09%) out of 217 adult sera were found to be seropositive. One seropositive adult patient was confirmed parasitologically as HVL after bone marrow aspiration and treated with AmBisome (R) while the other was followed only serologically because of the absence of symptoms. The overall canine leishmaniasis seroprevalence was found to be 20.7%. Sand flies were collected using CDC light traps in three out of five study sites and midguts; of females were checked for promastigotes after dissection/identification. Eight Phlebotomus species were found in the region. Phlebotomus neglectus and R papatasi were determined as dominant species with the ratio of 43.52% and 37.35%, respectively. No promastigotes were found in the midgut specimens. In addition, the results showed the presence of vector sand fly Species, as well as a high seroprevalence of anti-Leishmania antibodies among dogs from rural and a suburban area of Denizli province with a large proportion of asymptomatic seropositive dogs."
"IMMUNOFLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TEST (IFAT) FOR TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI IN DOGS FROM URBAN AND RURAL AREAS OF PELOTAS, RS","Chagas disease (CD) is a zoonosis with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi as the causative agent. Dogs are considered the main domestic reservoir for T. cruzi in most Latin American countries and in some areas of the United States. In southern Brazil, despite being an endemic area of the disease, the prevalence in dogs is still unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of T. cruzi antibodies in dogs from urban and rural areas of Pelotas, RS, Brazil. A total of 227 canine sera were used for serological tests, of which 99 were from urban areas and 128 were from rural areas of Pelotas. Information regarding the environment and the possible risk factors (origin, rural contact, age, breed, confinement and gender) to which the dogs were exposed were recorded. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to assess the presence of specific immunoglobulins (IgG) anti-T. cruzi in the serum of dogs. Of the 227 sera analyzed, 81 (35.7%) exhibited anti-T. cruzi, which represented 34.3% of the dogs from the urban area and 36.7% of the dogs from the rural area. Among the variables analyzed, rural contact and male gender showed an association with seropositivity for T. cruzi. The detection of T. cruzi antibodies in the serum of these dogs emphasizes the need to study trypanosomiasis in this important domestic reservoir of Chagas disease."
"Nosema bombi (Microsporidia: Nosematidae) and Trypanosomatid Prevalence in Spring Bumble Bee Queens "" (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Bombus) in Kansas","Several species of bumble bees are declining in the United States; these declining populations often show higher prevalence of Nosema bombi, a microsporidian pathogen. To date, surveys of bumble bee pathogens in the United States have only been conducted on workers and males, yet the health of a population is ultimately dependent on the success of colony-founding queens. We conducted a molecular-diagnostic survey of the prevalence of N. bombi and trypanosomatids, such as Crithidia bombi, in six species of spring queens Os = 142) collected in 2011 and 2013 at three sites in central Kansas. Nosema bombi was found in 27% of Bombus pensylvanicus and 13% of B. auricomus but was not found in the other species sampled. Trypanosomatids were only found in B. pensylvanicus (9%) during the May 2013 sampling period. The high prevalence of N. bombi in B. pensylvanicus is consistent with other surveys for this pathogen in other castes, but the high prevalence of N. bombi in B. auricomus is a novel finding. Although the conservation status of B. auricomus has not been thoroughly assessed, two recently published surveys showed that B. auricomus were less common in portions of the species' range. Based on those findings and an oft-cited link between N. bombi prevalence and bumble bee species' decline (e.g., B. pensylvanicus) in other studies, our findings suggest B. auricomus populations in Kansas may warrant further scrutiny."
Novel multiplex PCR reveals multiple trypanosomatid species infecting North American bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Bombus),"Crithidia bombi and Crithidia expoeki (Trypanosomatidae) are common parasites of bumble bees (Bombus spp.). Crithidia bombi was described in the 1980s, and C. expoeki was recently discovered using molecular tools. Both species have cosmopolitan distributions among their bumble bee hosts, but there have been few bumble bee studies that have identified infections to species since the original description of C. expoeki in 2010. Morphological identification of species is difficult due to variability within each stage of their complex lifecycles, although they can be easily differentiated through DNA sequencing. However, DNA sequencing can be expensive, particularly with many samples to diagnose. In order to reliably and inexpensively distinguish Crithidia species for a large-scale survey, we developed a multiplex PCR protocol using species-specific primers with a universal trypanosomatid primer set to detect unexpected relatives. We applied this method to 356 trypanosomatid-positive bumble bees from North America as a first-look at the distribution and host range of each parasite in the region. Crithidia bombi was more common (90.2%) than C. expoeki (21.3%), with most C. expoeki-positive samples existing as co-infections with C. bombi (13.8%). This two-step detection method also revealed that 2.2% samples were positive for trypanosmatids that were neither C. bombi nor C. expoeki. Sequencing revealed that two individuals were positive for C. mellificae, one for Lotmaria passim, and three for two unclassified trypanosomatids. This two-step method is effective in diagnosing known bumble bee infecting Crithidia species, and allowing for the discovery of unknown potential symbionts."
TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI AND LEISHMANIA SP INFECTION IN WILDLIFE FROM URBAN RAINFOREST FRAGMENTS IN NORTHEAST BRAZIL,"Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania sp. are important protozoan parasites for humans and animals in the Americas, causing Chagas disease and cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis, respectively. These vector-borne diseases affect permanent and transient populations in developing tropical countries that exhibit favorable conditions for the perpetuation of the parasite cycle. Our objective was to investigate the occurrence of infection with these parasites in wild animals from urban rainforest fragments in the city of Salvador, the largest city in the northeast region of Brazil. Sixty-five wild animals were captured, clinically examined, and sampled for parasite detection by PCR and culture. Ten different mammalian genera were identified, being 58% (38/65) marsupials. The prevalence of T. cruzi and Leishmania sp. infections was 13% and 43%, respectively. Both parasites were detected by PCR in 11% (7/65), three of which were also double infected as determined by culture. Among the 28 animals found infected with at least one parasite (43%, 28/65), 68% (19/28) were marsupials, two specimens were Callithrix sp. (7%), and one was Trinomys sp. (3%). Most infected animals (89%) had no clinical signs of disease. We found that healthy free-living animals from urban rainforest fragments harbored pathogenic trypanosomatids and should be included in epidemiology studies of diseases in big cities in tropical countries, as these cities grow and engulf rainforest remnants."
Leishmania infection in rodents in Greece,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence of Leishmania infection in rodents from various areas of northern Greece. METHODS Ninety-seven rodents (66 Mus musculus, 19 Rattus norvegicus and 12 R. rattus) were collected during pest control programmes and examined by cytology (spleen and liver smears), serology (ELISA) and PCR (real-time and gel-based) for Leishmania. Date, environment, sex, existence of dogs in the close environment were recorded for each rodent. RESULTS All cytological preparations were negative, whereas specific IgG was detected in 54.5% in total; 70% of R. norvegicus; 50% of R. rattus; and 50% of M. musculus. In at least one molecular method, 19.6% of the samples in total were positive: 25% of R. rattus, 24% of M. musculus, but no R. norvegicus was found positive. Environment (semi-urban areas, P = 0.037) and species (M. musculus, P = 0.032) were associated with positive PCR. All infected animals showed evidence of low parasite burden, demonstrated by the negative cytological examinations and the high Ct values observed in real-time PCR. CONCLUSION Due to the proximity of rodents to humans and dogs, these animals may be important in the epidemiology of leishmaniosis, especially if proven that they can infect sand flies."
"Detection of Anti-Leishmania Antibodies (Trypanosomatidae) in Canine Populations in the Department of Sucre, Colombia","The aim of this survey was to determine prevalence of antibodies against Leishmania in dogs from Sucre, Colombia. We analyzed 122 dogs in rural areas from municipalities of Sampus, Ovejas and Sincelejo, by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). Anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected in 69.6 % (95 % CI = 61.1 to 78.2) of the selected canine population. In the municipality of Sincelejo, Sampues and Ovejas, the seropositivities were 72 % (95 % CI = 61.1 to 82.8), 68.4 % (95 % CI = 52.3 to 84.5) and 55.5 % (95 % CI = 21.2 to 86.3) respectively. Seropositive animals were mainly young and adult dogs. The 17.6 % of seropositive dogs showed clinical signs compatible with canine leishmaniasis; onychogryphosis, alopecia and cachexia were the most common ones. The detected high frequency of canines with antibodies against Leishmania in the present study, highlights the hyperendemicity status of canine leishmaniasis in this area of the country and the high risk of disease outbreaks."
Cerebral trypanosomiasis in native cattle,"During the late rainy season and winter season in 1990, outbreaks of suspected trypanosomiasis in native cattle (Bas indicus) occurred on 13 farms in Petchaboon province, Thailand. Forty-two cattle presented with nervous symptoms including circling, excitation, jumping, aggressive behavior, lateral recumbency, convulsion and finally death. Blood samples from 39 cattle on the two farms in which the outbreaks occurred were collected and examined for the presence of Trypanosoma evansi. It was found that all 16 blood samples from cattle on farm A were positive of T. evansi by mouse inoculation and indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). In cattle from farm B, on the other hand only 37.5% and 39% of the samples were positive by mouse inoculation and IFAT, respectively. T. evansi was detected on impression smears of organs from the three cattle which died with nervous symptoms and also in smears made from their cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, trypanosomes were isolated from the cerebrum, cerebellum, pens and spinal cord by mouse inoculation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V."

"Prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection in equines and camels in the Punjab region, Pakistan","A cross-sectional study has been carried out in order to determine the prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection in susceptible hosts in the Punjab region (Pakistan). A total of 170 equines and 150 dromedary camels were examined. Five (3.3%) and 6 (4%) camels were positive at parasitological and serological examination, respectively. None of the equines tested positive at any method. These results seem to indicate that T evansi infection has a relatively low prevalence in the Punjab region. However, efforts must be done in order to establish control measures in affected herds and avoid dissemination of the disease."
Identification of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in naturally infected dogs in Nigeria,"Background Animal trypanosomosis is endemic in Nigeria, while the human disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is rarely reported nowadays after efforts to bring it under control in the 20th century. The University of Nigeria Veterinary Teaching Hospital (UNVTH) is a reference centre located within the Nsukka area and serves Enugu and neighboring states, Benue, Kogi, Anambra and Delta. Among dogs presented to the UNVTH with canine trypanosomosis, T. brucei is frequently reported as the causative agent. However, this is by morphological identification under the microscope, which does not allow distinction of human-infective (T. b. gambiense) and non-human-infective (T. b. brucei) subspecies. Here, we used subspecies-specific PCR tests to distinguish T. b. gambiense and T. b. brucei. Methods Blood samples were collected on FTA cards from 19 dogs presenting with clinical signs of trypanosomosis at the UNVTH from January 2017 to December 2018. All dogs had a patent parasitaemia. DNA was extracted from the FTA cards using Chelex 100 resin and used as template for PCR. Results All infections were initially identified as belonging to subgenus Trypanozoon using a generic PCR test based on the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) of the ribosomal RNA locus and a PCR test specific for the 177 bp satellite DNA of subgenus Trypanozoon. None of the samples were positive using a specific PCR test for T. evansi Type A kinetoplast DNA minicircles. Further PCR tests specific for T. b. gambiense based on the TgsGP and AnTat 11.17 genes revealed that two of the dogs harboured T. b. gambiense. In addition to trypanosomes of subgenus Trypanozoon, T. congolense savannah was identified in one dog using a species-specific PCR test for this taxon. Conclusions Nineteen dogs presenting with canine African trypanosomosis at UNVTH were infected with trypanosomes of the T. brucei group and in two cases the trypanosomes were further identified to subspecies T. b. gambiense using specific PCR tests. Thus T. b. gambiense is one of the parasites responsible for canine African trypanosomosis in the Nsukka area of Nigeria and represents a serious danger to human health."
"TESA-blot for the diagnosis of Chagas disease in dogs from co-endemic regions for Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma evansi and Leishmania chagasi","We standardized serodiagnosis of dogs infected with Trypanosoma cruzi using TESA (trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigen)-blot developed for human Chagas disease. TESA-blot showed 100% sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, ELISA using TESA (TESA-ELISA) or epimastigotes (epi-ELISA) as antigen yielded 100% sensitivity but specificity of 94.1% and 49.4%, respectively. When used in field studies in an endemic region for Chagas disease, visceral leishmaniasis and Trypanosoma evansi (Mato Grosso do Sul state, Central Brazil), positivities were 9.3% for TESA-blot, 10.7% for TESA-ELISA and 32% for epi-ELISA. Dogs from a non-endemic region for these infections (Rondonia state, western Amazonia) where T cruzi is enzootic showed positivity of 4.5% for TESA-blot and epi-ELISA and 6.8% for TESA-ELISA. Sera from urban dogs from Santos, Sao Paulo, where these diseases are absent, yielded negative results. TESA-blot was the only method that distinguished dogs infected with T cruzi from those infected with Leishmania chagasi and/or Trypanosoma evansi. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V."
"A Serologic Survey on Canine Leishmaniasis in Kocaeli, Sakarya, Mersin and Elazig Provinces of Turkey","The aims of this pilot study were to determine the seroprevalence of canine leishmaniasis in Kocaeli, Sakarya, Mersin and Elazig provinces and make a general evaluation of the serologic prevelence of Canine Leishmaniasis (CanL) in Turkey. For this purpose, 111 sera were collected from dogs of different breeds, ages and sexes. Anti-Leishmania IgG antibodies were detected with a commercially available IFAT kit. The relationship between location, breed, age, sex and the seropositivity were evaluated with Chi Square (X-2) test. At the end of the study, the overall seroprevalence was determined as 7.20% (8/111). Seroprevalance rates were 5%, 10.52% and 18.75% in Sakarya, Kocaeli and Mersin provinces, respectively; however, no antibodies were detected in dogs from Elazig. There was no statistical difference in breed, sex and age groups (P>0.05). The prevalence of infection in the province of Mersin was significantly higher than in Elazig (p<0.05). The mean seroprevalence of CanL was calculated as 7.29% for Turkey, which is similar to our results (7.20%). In this study, we gave information about the serostatus of CanL in four different provinces of Turkey. We consider that further studies are required for a clearer understanding of the parasite epidemiology and effective control measures."
"Occurrence of antibodies anti-Neospora caninum, anti-Toxoplasma gondii, and anti-Leishmania chagasi in serum of dogs from Para State, Amazon, Brazil","A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the occurrence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii, anti-Neospora caninum, and anti- Leishmania chagasi antibodies in dogs of the state of Para, Brazil. For this purpose, 129 blood samples were collected from dogs of different ages and gender. Samples of 72 dogs were collected from 39 rural properties from 19 municipalities, and 57 samples were from stray dogs, collected after captivity by the Center of Zoonosis Control from the municipality of Santar,m. The sera were analyzed for anti-T. gondii and anti-N. caninum antibodies by indirect fluorescent antibody tests with cutoff values of 1:16 and 1:50, respectively. For the presence of L. chagasi antibodies, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used and positive results were confirmed by immunochromatographic method using the recombinant antigen K39. Of the total of 129 dogs, 90 (69.8%) were positive for T. gondii, 16 (12.4%) for N. caninum, and 30 (23.3%) for L. chagasi. Antibodies for all three parasites were found simultaneously in seven dogs (5.4%), mostly in urban dogs (six of seven). No association was observed related to gender and location (urban or rural) of dogs and occurrence of N. caninum and T. gondii antibodies although, regarding L. chagasi, higher prevalence was found in females (P < 0.02) and in dogs from urban location (P < 0.001). From the 39 farms, in 30 (76.9%) at least one dog was positive for T. gondii or N. caninum or both. Higher occurrence of Leishmania antibodies was observed in N. caninum-negative dogs (P < 0.05)."
"Natural Leishmania Infection of Lutzomyia auraensis in Madre de Dios, Peru, Detected by a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer-Based Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","Leishmania species of the Viannia subgenus are responsible for most cases of New World tegumentary leishmaniasis. However, little is known about the vectors involved in disease transmission in the Amazon regions of Peru. We used a novel real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess Leishmania infections in phlebotomines collected in rural areas of Madre de Dios, Peru. A total of 1,299 non-blood fed female sand flies from 33 species were captured by using miniature CDC light traps. Lutzomyia auraensis was the most abundant species (63%) in this area. Seven of 164 pools were positive by PCR for Leishmania by kinetoplast DNA. The real-time PCR identified four Lu. auraensis pools as positive for L. (Viannia) lainsoni and L. (V.) braziliensis. The minimum infection prevalence for Lu. auraensis was estimated to be 0.6% (95% confidence interval = 0.20-1.42%). Further studies are needed to assess the importance of Lu. auraensis in the transmission of New World tegumentary leishmaniasis in hyperendemic areas of Peru."
Hemoparasites in birds Columbidae from Venezuela 2012-2015,
A comparison of the blood parasites in three subspecies of the yellow wagtail Motacilla flava,"One-hundred and eighty yellow wagtails Motacilla flava belonging to 3 subspecies (Motacilla flava feldegg, Motacilla flava flava, Motacilla flava thunbergi) were caught during the spring migration in south Kazakhstan and investigated by microscopic examination of stained blood smears. Haemoproteus anthi, Haemoproteus motacillae, Leucocytozoon fringillinarum, Leucocytozoon majoris, Plasmodium relictum, Plasmodium polare, Atoxoplasma sp., Trypanosoma sp., and microfilariae were identified. The overall prevalence of infection was 47.8%. Prevalences of Haemoproteus spp. (27.2%), Plasmodium spp. (25.0%), Leucocytozoon spp. (8.9%), Atoxoplasma spp. (4.4%), Trypanosoma spp. (1.1%), and microfilariae (0.6%) were recorded. No differences were discernible in parasite fauna or intensities of infection between males and females or between different subspecies. However, prevalence of infection of Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Plasmodium spp, was different in different host subspecies. These differences can be explained by differences in geographical location of breeding areas of these birds."
Additional observations on blood parasites of birds in Costa Rica,"Birds from the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica were surveyed for blood parasites in June 2001 and December 2001-January 2002. Of 354 birds examined, representing 141 species of 35 families and 15 orders, 44 (12.4%) were infected with blood parasites. Species of Haemoproteus (4.8% prevalence), Plasmodium (0.6%), Leucocytozoon (0.3%), Trypanosoma (2.0%), and microfilariae (7.6%) were recorded. Twelve species of birds in this survey were examined for blood parasites for the first time. Several new host-parasite associations were identified."
"TWO NEW TRYPANOSOMA SPECIES FROM AFRICAN BIRDS, WITH NOTES ON THE TAXONOMY OF AVIAN TRYPANOSOMES","Trypanosoma anguiformis n. sp. and Trypanosoma polygranularis n. sp. are described from the African olive sunbird, Cyanomitra olivacea, and Latham's forest francolin, Francolinus lathami, respectively, based on the morphology of their hematozoic trypomastigotes and partial sequences of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Both new species belong to the group of small non-striated avian trypanosomes (<30 mu m in length on average) with the kinetoplast situated close to the posterior end of the body. Trypanosoma anguiformis can be readily distinguished from other small avian trypanosomes due to its markedly attenuated (snake-shaped) form of the hematozoic trypomastigotes and the dumbbell-shaped nucleus of the parasite. Trypanosoma polygranularis is readily distinguishable due to the markedly off-center (anteriorly) located nucleus, numerous azurophilic granules that are arranged in a line following the undulating membrane, and the large kinetoplast (with an area up to 1.7 mu m(2) [1.1 mu m(2) on average]). Illustrations of hematozoic trypomastigotes of the new species are given, and DNA lineages associated with these parasites are reported. The current situation in species taxonomy of avian trypanosomes is discussed. We call for the redescription of valid species of avian trypanosomes from their type vertebrate hosts and type localities by using morphological and polymerase chain reaction-based techniques as an initial essential step towards revising the species composition of avian trypanosomes and reconstructing the taxonomy of these organisms."
High prevalence and diversity of blood parasites of passerine birds in Southern Turkmenistan,
High prevalence of blood parasites in hawfinch Coccothraustes coccothraustes,"Fifty-seven hawfinches Coccothraustes coccothraustes were caught in May-June 1982-2001 on the Curonian Spit in the Baltic Sea and investigated by microscopical examination of stained blood films. Haemoproteus fringillae, H. tartakovskyi, Leucocytozoon dubreuili, L. fringillinarum, L. majoris, Plasmodium relictum, P. vaughani, Trypanosoma avium, T. everetti , and microfilariae were identified. The overall prevalence of infection was 100%. Prevalences of Haemoproteus spp. (89.5%), Plasmodium spp. (61.4%), Leucocytozoon spp. (78.9%), Trypanosoma spp. (26.3%), and microfilariae (29.8%) were recorded. No differences were discernible in parasite fauna, prevalence, or intensity of infection between males and females or between young and adult birds. The majority of infections (86.0% of all birds) were mixed, with parasites from two to five different genera present in each blood smear. These birds were failed breeders migrating through the Curonian Spit. It is probable that heavy haematozoan infections can influence the breeding success of birds."
Further observations on the blood parasites of birds in Uganda,"Birds from three National Parks (Bwindi Impenetrable, Kibale, and Queen Elizabeth) in western Uganda were surveyed during the dry season in July 2003 and investigated for hematozoa by microscopic examination of stained blood films. Of 307 birds examined, representing 68 species of 15 families and four orders, 61.9% were found to be infected with blood parasites. Species of Haemoproteus (15.3% prevalence), Plasmodium (20.5%), Leucocytozoon (40.1%), Trypanosoma (11.4%), Hepatozoon (2.6%), Atoxoplasma (0.3%), and microfilariae (3.9%) were recorded. Except for Haemoproteus spp. infections, the overall prevalence of hematozoa belonging to all genera was significantly higher in this study than was previously reported in Uganda. Thirty-six species of birds were examined for blood parasites for the first time and 112 new host-parasite associations were identified. Eighty-one were at the generic and 31 at the specific level of the hematozoa. Hepatozoon and Atoxoplasma spp. were detected for the first time in Uganda."
Bumble bee parasite prevalence but not genetic diversity impacted by the invasive plant impatiens glandulifera,
Viral and intestinal diseases detected in Apis mellifera in Central and Southern Chile,"The honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) is an important pollinator worldwide. Beekeepers have experienced an increasing loss of colonies in recent years and pathologies including viruses and intestinal parasites such as Nosema ceranae are among those held responsible for this decline. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution, using the real time PCR method, of six honeybee viruses including Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), Sacbrood Virus (SBV), Acute Bee Paralysis Virus (ABPV), Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV) and Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) in addition to three intestinal parasites, N. ceranae, N. apis and Lotmaria passim in Chilean beehives distributed between the Metropolitan Region and La Araucania Region. Among the viruses, BQCV was the most prevalent in the analyzed hives, ranging from 72% to 100%, N. ceranae was detected between 19% to 53% and L. passim showed infections ranging from 45% to 73%. Similarly, BQCV (96%) and N. ceranae (42%) were more prevalent in spring-summer whilst DWV (37%) and L. passim (68%) were more frequents in autumn-winter seasons. Furthermore, mixed infections were also detected, wherein viruses were found along with L. passim or viruses with N. ceranae and L. passim, which proved to be the most prevalent. Of the 467 hives analyzed, 97.2% were infected with one or more of the studied pathogens, indicating that they are widely spread in Chile."
"Identification of new epidemiological scenarios for Chagas disease in the Momposina region, North of Colombia","Introduction: The Momposina region is one of the most interesting areas to study new epidemiological scenarios for Chagas disease in Colombia. Objectives: To determine the presence of a source of peridomestic transmission of T. cruzi and its epidemiological risk in the Momposina region, based on the bimodal weather pattern characteristic of Colombia. Materials and methods: Four surveys over two years (two in the rainy season and two during the dry one) were conducted. Triatomines feces and blood samples from human and reservoirs were evaluated for presence of antibodies and parasites by ELISA, IFI and PCR. The conditions of housing, feeding triatomine state and involvement of dogs in the transmission were assessed. Results. High rates of infection with T. cruzi in insects and wild animals were found. Infection rates of T. cruzi in dogs (15%) and humans (16.8%) were found. The results obtained in this study indicated that in the dry season there is increased risk of infection with T. cruzi, given the higher population density of insects, the higher percentage of fed insects and the higher rate of infection. Conclusion: These results confirm the presence and movement of a peridomestic outbreak of T. cruzi and describes some risk factors for the eco-epidemiological area, suggesting new epidemiological scenarios for Chagas disease in Colombia."
"The current status of phlebotomine sand flies in Albania and incrimination of Phlebotomus neglectus (Diptera, Psychodidae) as the main vector of Leishmania infantum",
Natural infection of Triatominae bugs in Mexican dwellings,"Objective. To estimate the prevalence of infection with Trypanosoma cruzi in Triatominae species frequently found in and around Mexican dwellings, and to assess the frequency of Triatominae in towns by state. Material and methods. Between January 1993 and December 1999, 5 399 Triatominae bugs from 14 states of Mexico, were received in the Department of Entomology of the Institute for Epidemiologic Diagnosis and Referral (InDRE), for taxonomic determination and parasitoscopical search of Trypanosoma cruzi. Results obtained between 1993 and 1999 were analyzed globally. Results. From 13 bug species associated with human dwellings, nine were naturally infected with T. cruzi. The highest percentage of infection occurred in Triatoma pallidipennis, T. picurata, Rhodnius prolixus and T. longipennis. Nayarit, Morelos, and Michoacan were the states with the highest percentage of infected bugs. The species T. dimidiata, T. gerstaeckeri, T. longgennis, T. mexicana and T. paliidipennis were first state records and Pastrongylus rufotuberculatus was a first local record. Conclusions. These findings stress the importance of studying the biology of Triatominae and the need for permanent surveillance, to allow for up-to-date distribution records of Triatominae species in and around human dwellings, those adapting to human dwellings, and frequencies of those naturally infected by T. cruzi."
"Natural infection and distribution of triatomines (Hemiptera : Reduviidae) in the state of Queretaro, Mexico","Chagas disease is present in Mexico but data on the presence of its vectors are not known for all the states. We conducted an epidemiological study to ascertain the presence of bedbugs in 23 communities of seven municipalities in the state of Queretaro, Mexico. Sampling was performed within and outside dwellings, using the technique of one person searching per hour per house. Four triatomine species were found: Triatoma mexicana (94%), Tri. dimidiata (3%), Tri. gerstaecked (2%) and Tri. pallidipennis (1%). Triatoma mexicana was found in six of the seven municipalities but has previously been found only in the state of Hidalgo, where it is considered the most important vector species of Trypanosoma cruzi. This is the first time that the presence of Tri. gerstaeckeri or Tri. dimidiata has been reported in the state of Queretaro. Toliman municipality had the highest entomological indices: infestation index 73%; infection index 34.5%; crowding index 9.2%; density index 6.7%; and colonization index 20.6%. Although the prevalence and colonization indices were tow, the infestation and infection indices indicate that different Triatoma species are becoming established in Queretaro. This work represents the first entomological study in this Mexican state and suggests that some triatomine vectors are extraordinarily mobile. (c) 2008 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

Pathological alterations and prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi in opossums from western Mexico,"There are scarce reports about lesions and pathological alterations by Trypanosoma cruzi infections on opossums (Didelphis virginiana), considered some of the most important reservoir hosts for T. cruzi in western Mexico. After two serological analyses (Serodia and IHA), 12 (24%) of 50 collected opossums in two small towns in western Mexico were positive for the presence of T. cruzi. Eight had some kind of organ alterations: four with alterations in only one organ, three in two organs and one with alterations in three organs. Splenomegaly was the most common alteration in the examined opossums. In light of the present findings, it is possible that organ alterations on studied opossums may have been associated with T. cruzi infections."
Molecular characterization of Trypanosoma evansi isolates from water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) in the Philippines,"Trypanosoma evansi infection in the Philippines is frequently reported to affect the country's livestock, particularly, the buffaloes. To assess the prevalence and intraspecific diversity of T. evansi in the country, blood samples from water buffaloes in different geographical regions were collected during an outbreak. T. evansi was detected in all 79 animals tested using PCR targeting the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene. Sequencing of the rDNA complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region including the 5.8S subunit showed high similarity (99-100%) between Philippine isolates and known T. evansi isolates in Genbank. Tree construction based on the same region confirmed the close relationship between Philippine and reported Thai isolates as compared to Egyptian isolates separated by relatively small genetic distances, 47 polymorphisms, despite the clustering in four branches. Overall, the results of this study prove genetic diversity within T. evansi species despite previous reports on limited heterogeneity among isolates worldwide."
First Report of Trypanosoma cruzi Infection in Salivary Gland of Bats from the Peruvian Amazon,"In the Americas, 8 million people are infected with Chagas disease, and an additional 90 million people are at risk for infection. Little is known about the role bats play in the sylvatic transmission cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing Chagas disease. Here, we captured bats in the villages of Palmiche, Pachacutec, Nuevo San Martin, and Mayuriaga located in the Datem del Maranon Province in Loreto, Peru. Venous blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture or from the upper extremities, and trypanosomatids were identified by microscopy and molecularly. We collected blood samples from 121 bats on filter paper for molecular studies and 111 slides for microscopic examination of thin and thick blood smears from 16 different bat species. The prevalence of trypanosomatids in all bats species was 34.7% (42/121) and the prevalence of T. cruzi was 4.1% (5/121). In hematophagous bat species, the prevalence of trypanosomatids and T. cruzi was 36.9% (27/73) and 2.7% (2/73), respectively. In non-hematophagous bats, the prevalences of trypanosomatids and T. cruzi were 31.2% (15/48) and 6.2% (3/48), respectively. Also, we confirm the presence of T. cruzi in salivary glands of hematophagous bats Diaemus youngi. These results suggest a sylvatic cycle of trypanosomatid transmission in which bats may harbor infectious T. cruzi parasites that could be transmitted to humans via hematophagous bat bites or salivary contamination by non-hematophagous bats of vegetables consumed by humans."
"Prevalence of antibodies against visceralizing Leishmania spp. in brown rats from Grenada, West Indies","Background and Aim: Leishmania spp. are known to cause disease in man and animals. Rats are considered important reservoir hosts and transmission takes place through the bite of female sand fly, Phlebotomus spp. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published information on Leishmania infection in rats in Grenada. This study was conducted to estimate the antibodies for visceralizing Leishmania spp. (VL) in rats (Rattus norvegicus) from Grenada. Materials and Methods: A total of 146 brown rats (R. norvegicus) were trapped live from two parishes (St. George and St. David) in Grenada. Following anesthesia, blood was collected from the heart through thoracic puncture. The serum was collected after the centrifugation of blood. Serum was tested for antibodies to VL. with a commercially available immunochromatographic dipstick test which is licensed for use in animals and humans. Results: The seroprevalence of antibodies against Leishmania spp. was found in 34 of 146 rats (23.3%; CI 95% from 16.70 to 30.99). No significant differences were found between sexes and young or adults. The prevalence between parishes (St. George and St. David) was also not significant. Conclusion: The results show that rats (R. norvegicus) in Grenada are exposed to Leishmania spp. The rats could play an important role in the transmission of leishmaniasis to humans and other animals in Grenada."
Phylogenetic relationships of trypanosomatids parasitising true bugs (Insecta: Heteroptera) in sub-Saharan Africa,"Three hundred and eighty-six heteropteran specimens belonging to more than 90 species captured in Ghana, Kenya and Ethiopia were examined for the presence of trypanosomatid flagellates. Of those, 100 (26%) specimens were positive for trypanosomatids and the spliced leader RNA gene sequence was obtained from 81(80%) of the infected bugs. Its sequence-based analysis placed all examined flagellates in 28 typing units. Among 19 newly described typing units, 16 are restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, three belong to previously described species and six to typing units found on other continents. This result was corroborated by the analysis of the ssrRNA gene, sequenced for at least one representative of each major spliced leader RNA-based clade. In all trees obtained, flagellates originating from sub-Saharan Africa were intermingled with those isolated from American, Asian and European hosts, revealing a lack of geographic correlation. They are dispersed throughout most of the known diversity of monoxenous trypanosomatids. However, a complex picture emerged when co-evolution with their heteropteran hosts was taken into account, since some clades are specific for a single host clade, family or even species, whereas other flagellates display a very low host specificity, with a capacity to parasitise heteropteran bugs belonging to different genera/families. The family Reduviidae contains the widest spectrum of trypanosomatids, most likely a consequence of their predatory feeding behaviour, leading to an accumulation of a variety of flagellates from their prey. The plant pathogenic genus Phytomonas is reported here from Africa, to our knowledge for the first time. Finding the same typing units in hosts belonging to different heteropteran families and coming from different continents strongly indicates that the global diversity of the insect trypanosomatids is most likely lower than was predicted on the basis of the ""one host-one parasite"" paradigm. The analysis presented significantly extends the known diversity of monoxenous insect trypanosomatids and will be instrumental in building a new taxonomy that reflects their true phylogenetic relationships.

Cosmopolitan Distribution of a Trypanosomatid Leptomonas pyrrhocoris,"A trypanosomatid species, designated as Typing Unit 1 (TU1) by sequences of SL RNA gene repeats, has been found in the intestine of pyrrhocorids (Insecta: Heteroptera) in Europe, Mediterranean, Central America and some parts of Asia and Africa. Phylogenetic analysis of the SL repeat sequences has shown that the isolates group in the tree according to their geographic origin. The maximal sequence divergence was observed in parasites from Neotropics suggesting the origin within and subsequent migrations from this region. The global distribution of the parasite could have been facilitated by ubiquity of its hosts that include several genera of the family Pyrrhocoridae. In Europe the TU1 flagellates frequently occur in Pyrrhocoris apterus, the host of Leptomonas pyrrhocoris Zotta, 1912, a species that had been insufficiently defined by host and light microscopy level morphology. Herein, the Zotta's species description has been amended to include the TU1 SL RNA repeat, SSU rRNA, glycosomal GAPDH gene sequences, as well as ultrastructure. In addition, Leptomonas scantii n. sp. with an overlapping host range has been described. Moreover, 10 typing units of trypanosomatids found in the pyrrhocorid hosts demonstrate the extent of variability of trypanosomatids occurring in one host family. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

High Prevalence and Endemism of Trypanosomatids on a Small Caribbean Island,
Probing into the diversity of trypanosomatid flagellates parasitizing insect hosts in South-West China reveals both endemism and global dispersal,"Flagellates of the class Kinetoplastea are known to frequently Parasitize insects. We have collected 67 isolates from 407 Heteroptera hosts captured in several locations of South-West China. Their splice leader (SL) RNA gene repeats and small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes were PCR amplified from the infected tissue samples. In most cases, parasites were found in the midgut, rarely the infection was confined to the Malpighian tubes. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences has significantly expanded the known diversity of these monoxenous parasites. Fifteen typing units were found among these isolates including 11 potentially new species. Four typing units matched the previously known typing units from the Neotropics indicating a global distribution of the respective parasite species. At the same time, new clades appeared, testifying for a certain level of endemism. The host record of the parasites found indicated a variable specificity level of the host-parasite association including several cases of a very broad host range. Our results disprove the ""one host - one parasite"" paradigm and show that although the global diversity of monoxenous parasites is high, it is not as enormous as suggested earlier. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence, among the isolated strains, of a new Phytomonas species, which is the first documentation of this potentially pathogenic dixenous parasite of plants in China.

An unexpected diversity of trypanosomatids in fecal samples of great apes,"Charismatic great apes have been used widely and effectively as flagship species in conservation campaigns for decades. These iconic representatives of their ecosystems could also play a role as reservoirs of several zoonotic diseases. Recently it was demonstrated that African great apes can host Leishmania parasites (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae). Given that this finding raised a strong negative reaction from leishmania experts and the subsequent discussion did not lead to a clear resolution, we decided to analyze wild gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) fecal samples collected from the same area in Cameroon as in the original study. Fecal samples, used to circumvent the difficulties and ethics involved in obtaining blood samples from endangered wild apes, were screened by three different PCR assays for detection of Leishmania DNA. We did not detect any leishmania parasites in analyzed feces; however, sequencing of SSU rRNA revealed an unexpected diversity of free-living bodonids (Kinetoplastea: Bodonidae) and parasitic trypanosomatids (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae) other than Leishmania. A single detected Phytomonas species, found in chimpanzee feces, most likely originated from animal plant food. On the other hand, the presence of four free-living bodonid species and four parasitic insect monoxenous trypanosomatid, including two possible new species of the genus Hetpetomonas, could be explained as ex post contamination of feces either from the environment or from flies (Diptera: Brachycera)."

Anti-Leishmania antibodies were evaluated in sera samples by IFA and ELISA techniques. The presence of D. immitis microfilariae was determined in blood samples by use of the modified Knott's test. Using the IFA and ELISA on 158 dogs surveyed, 5 (3.2%) were positive for anti-Leishmania antibodies while 22 (13.9%) were found infected with D. immitis. Only 2 out of 5 seropositive dogs exhibited major signs of canine visceral leishmaniosis, and amastigotes were detected in parasitological examinations of popliteal lymph node aspirates. It was noted that there were dogs infected with Leishmania in dog shelters in the towns of Kusadasi and Selcuk, and the infection rate of dogs for D. immitis was high in 3 villages near the city of Aydin."
Domestic animals as reservoirs for sleeping sickness in three endemic foci in south-eastern Uganda,"The persistence of sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis) in some areas of south-eastern Uganda has necessitated further investigations, focusing mainly on domestic animals as reservoirs of this disease in three agroecological zones. The inter-zone differences in the prevalences of trypanosome infection among cattle (P < 0.001) and pigs (P < 0.001) were significant. Overall, 5.0% of the cattle, 13.9% of the pigs and 0.4% of the small ruminants investigated were found to be infected with parasites of the Trypanosoma brucei subgroup. The results of blood incubation infectivity tests (BIIT) indicated that all of the T. brucei-subgroup isolates from cattle in Kamuli district (zone I) were human-serum-sensitive. Of the zone-I pigs found infected, however, almost all (82.5%) were considered to be infected with T. brucei and many (30.2%) carried human-serum-resistant T. brucei. Pig-tsetse-human appears to be a major transmission cycle in zone I. In Mukono district (zone 11), 10.5% and 26.1% of the T. brucei isolates from cattle and pigs, respectively, were human-serum-resistant, indicating that cattle-tsetse-human and pig-tsetse-human are major transmission cycles in zone II. In Tororo district (zone 111), 47.3% of the T. brucei isolates from cattle were human-serum-resistant but there were no T. brucei isolates from pigs, indicating that cattle-tsetse-human is the major transmission cycle. Interestingly, as the only T. brucei isolate from sheep in zone III was human-serum-resistant, there may also be a sheep-tsetse human cycle. In southeastern Uganda, control efforts must be designed to eliminate the parasites not only from cattle but also from pigs and small ruminants."
ELECTROPHORETIC KARYOTYPING IS A SENSITIVE EPIDEMIOLOGIC TOOL FOR STUDYING TRYPANOSOMA-EVANSI INFECTIONS,"Thirty-six isolates of trypanozoon trypanosomes collected from camels in Northern Kenya during the dry season sporadic infections of 1986 and during the wet season epidemic infections of 1987 were identified as Trypanosoma evansi by the homogeneity of their kinetoplast DNA minicircles. Although the minicircles of all the isolates were indistinguishable, polymorphism in chromosome-sized DNA molecules detected by electrophoresis was extensive. The isolates could be grouped into eight distinct electrophoretic karyotypes which could be distinguished from three additional karyotypes identified among earlier T. evansi isolates. In one camel herd with a long history of trypanocide application, which was continued during the present study, all isolates bar one belonged to one karyotype group. From a second herd, in which trypanosomosis management was by individual treatment of proven parasitaemic cases, isolates with diverse karyotypes were obtained. Some of the karyotypes identified during the dry season sporadic infections were re-isolated in the subsequent wet season epidemic. These observations indicate that distinguishing T. evansi isolates by molecular electrophoretic karyotypes is more discriminating than kDNA analysis. Observations of karyotype patterns recurring in isolates from herds kept under chemoprophylaxis could help in the identification of drug-resistant parasites."
The prevalence of canine Leishmania infantum infection in western China detected by PCR and serological tests,"Background: Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is endemic in western China, resulting in important public health problem. It is essential to evaluate the prevalence of canine Leishmania infantum infection for designing control policy. In the present study we report for the first time prevalence of Leishmania infection in dogs living in Jiuzhaigou County (Sichuan Provence, China), which is not only an important endemic area of CanL but also a tourism scenic spot, detected by PCR, ELISA and dipstick test. The results could provide key information for designing control programs against canine and human leishmaniasis. In addition, the complete sequence of the Leishmania isolate from Sichuan Province has not been reported to date and we present the sequences of 116 base-pair (bp) fragment of the conserved region in the minicircle kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) and the results of phylogenetic analyses based on the sequence of the amplified fragment. Results: The proportion of dogs infected with Leishmania in Jiuzhaigou County was 36.79%, 9.43%, and 51.88% detected by ELISA, dipstick test, and PCR, respectively. The ELISA and PCR tests were more sensitive than dipstick test. The PCR method is the most sensitive way to detect dogs infected with Leishmania parasites. The total positive rate for infected dogs in the area was 59.43% by the three methods. The PCR products of 116-bp fragment amplified from the kDNA conserved region of dog blood samples and laboratory maintained L. infantum were DNA sequenced and the variation of the sequences was observed. The phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of 116-bp fragment reveals that L. infantum is more genetically related to visceralizing species L. donovani than to the Leishmania species associated with cutaneous disease. Conclusions: More than half of dogs living in the endemic Jiuzhaigou County were infected by L. infantum. Control measures, such as treatment or eradication of infected dogs, or prohibition of maintaining dogs, must be taken against these infected dogs due to their role in the transmission of the infection to vectors. The phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of conserved region in kDNA of Leishmania can effectively distinguish species of Leishmania."

Molecular Detection and Genetic Diversity of Leishmania donovani in Naturally Infected Phlebotomus chinensi from Southwestern China,"Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis is an important vector-borne infectious disease in western China. In this study, an epidemiological study was carried out on the vector of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in rural areas from Sichuan Province, southwestern China. In the 1263 phlebotomine sandflies captured, 859 (68.01%) were females and 404 (31.99%) males, belonging to Phlebotomus chinensis (83.37%), Sergentomyia koloshanensis (6.57%), Sergentomyia squamirostris (4.04%), and Sergentomyia barraudi (6.02%), respectively. The average prevalence of Leishmania parasites in P. chinensis females was 1.98%, which was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on ITS2-rDNA revealed that Leishmania parasites detected in sandflies belonged to the L. donovani group and formed a novel haplotype. This was the first report on molecular detection of L. donovani in naturally infected P. chinensi from China."
"PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HEMOPARASITES IN CATTLE AND GOATS AT THE EDGE OF KIBALE NATIONAL PARK, WESTERN UGANDA","Livestock production is a major sector of the Ugandan economy. Ugandan ruminant livestock (principally cattle and goats) are susceptible to hemoparasites that can cause serious clinical disease and production losses. Kibale National Park, in western Uganda, is a protected forest ecosystem surrounded by small-scale farms where cattle and goats are raised. We conducted a cross-sectional study of cattle and goats in this area and diagnosed hemoparasite infections by microscopy. We collected data on animal characteristics and management practices to assess risk factors associated with infection. We studied 186 cattle and 317 goats from 20 villages, including 16 villages directly adjacent to Kibale and 4 villages >= 3 km from the park boundary. Hemoparasites detected in cattle and goats were of the genera Theileria, Anaplasma, and Trypanosoma with a prevalence of 15.1%, 1.6%, and 4.3% respectively in cattle, and 10%, 6.0%, and 0.0%, respectively in goats. Trypanosomes infected approximately 8% of cattle in villages bordering Kibale but were never detected in cattle in ""control'' villages >= 3 km from the park. Trypanosomes were approximately 7 times more likely to infect animals in households that did not provide veterinary care to their animals than in households that provided routine veterinary care. Within cattle, Theileria infections were approximately 7 times more likely to occur in cross-bred cattle than in indigenous pure breeds. Anaplasma infections were approximately 3.5 times more likely to occur in cattle than in goats (no goats were diagnosed with Trypanosoma infection). These data suggest that proximity to the park, provision of veterinary care, and breed are significant risk factors for hemoparasites in this population of ruminants, and that, in general, cattle are more susceptible than goats."
"Genetic diversity, parasite prevalence and immunity in wild bumblebees","Inbreeding and a consequent loss of genetic diversity threaten small, isolated populations. One mechanism by which genetically impoverished populations may become extinct is through decreased immunocompetence and higher susceptibility to parasites. Here, we investigate the relationship between immunity and inbreeding in bumblebees, using Hebridean island populations of Bombus muscorum. We sampled nine populations and recorded parasite prevalence and measured two aspects of immunity: the encapsulation response and levels of phenoloxidase (PO). We found that prevalence of the gut parasite Crithidia bombi was higher in populations with lower genetic diversity. Neither measure of immune activity was correlated with genetic diversity. However, levels of PO declined with age and were also negatively correlated with parasite abundance. Our results suggest that as insect populations lose heterozygosity, the impact of parasitism will increase, pushing threatened populations closer to extinction."
Investigating the impact of deploying commercial Bombus terrestris for crop pollination on pathogen dynamics in wild bumble bees,"The use of commercial bumble bees for crop pollination has been implicated in the decline of wild bumble bees through the spread of pathogens. This study investigates whether diseases from commercial bumble bees threaten native species in the UK. We sampled bumble bees from ten soft fruit farms: five that deploy commercial Bombus terrestris and five that do not. Each farm was visited monthly throughout the summer and workers of B. terrestris; B. pratorum, B. pascuorum and B. lapidarius were captured. The faeces of these bees were inspected for the gut microparasites Crithidia spp., Nosema bombi and Apicystis bombi. Prevalence was defined as the proportion of individuals infected and abundance was defined as the number of pathogen cells per volume of bumble bee faeces. The prevalence of A. bombi and N. bombi was too low to analyse. The prevalence and abundance of Crithidia spp. was significantly different among bumble bee species. Overall, the prevalence of Crithidia spp. was initially lower on farms deploying commercial bumble bees, possibly due to a dilution effect caused by the high density of imported bees. Crithidia spp. prevalence in Bombus terrestris, however, rose sharply on commercial farms at the end of the season. One potential explanation is that commercial bumble bees contract the local pathogen, which is then rapidly transmitted among them due to the high bee density. Whilst our data provide no evidence of pathogen spillover to wild species, it would be premature to conclude with certainty that commercial colonies do not represent a disease risk to native bees in the UK and we urge further studies into this phenomenon."
Trypanosomatids are common and diverse parasites of Drosophila,"Drosophila melanogaster is an important model system of immunity and parasite resistance, yet most studies use parasites that do not naturally infect this organism. We have studied trypanosomatids in natural populations to assess the prevalence and diversity of these gut parasites. We collected several species of Drosophila from Europe and surveyed them for trypanosomatids using conserved primers for two genes. We have used the conserved GAPDH sequence to construct a phylogenetic tree and the highly variable spliced leader RNA to assay genetic diversity. All 5 of the species that we examined were infected, and the average prevalence ranged from 1 to 6%. There are several different groups of trypanosomatids, related to other monoxenous Trypanosomatidae. These may represent new trypanosomatid species and were found in different species of European Drosophila from different geographical locations. The detection of a little studied natural pathogen in D. melanogaster and related species provides new opportunities for research into both the Drosophila immune response and the evolution of hosts and parasites."
Clinical and molecular investigation of a canine distemper outbreak and vector-borne infections in a group of rescue dogs imported from Hungary to Switzerland,"Background: Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a major pathogen of dogs and wild carnivores worldwide. In Switzerland, distemper in domestic dogs is rarely reported. In recent years, the import of dogs from Eastern Europe to Switzerland has steadily increased. In the present study, we describe a distemper outbreak in 15 rescue dogs that were imported from Hungary to Switzerland by an animal welfare organisation. The data on vaccination and medical history were recorded (14 dogs), and the samples were collected to investigate CDV and vector-borne infections (13 dogs) and canine parvovirus infection (12 dogs). The dogs were monitored for six months. Results: One dog was euthanised directly after import. Thirteen dogs showed clinical signs after arrival, i.e., diarrhoea (57 %), coughing (43 %) and nasal and/or ocular discharge (21 %); radiographic findings that were compatible with bronchopneumonia were present in four dogs. CDV infection was diagnosed in 11 dogs (85 %); 10 dogs (91 %) tested PCR-positive in conjunctival swabs. Vector-borne infections (Babesia spp., Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis) were found in 4 dogs (31 %). Three dogs were hospitalized, and six dogs received ambulatory therapy for up to two months until recovery. None of the dogs developed neurological disease. CDV shedding was detected for a period of up to four months. Because dogs were put under strict quarantine until CDV shedding ceased, CDV did not spread to any other dogs. The CDV isolates showed 99 % sequence identity in the HA gene among each other and belonged to the Arctic-like lineage of CDV. Conclusions: The present study highlights the imminent risks of spreading contagious viral and vector-borne infections through the non-selective import of sick dogs and dogs with incomplete vaccination from Eastern Europe. CDV shedding was detected for several months after the cessation of clinical signs, which emphasised the roles of asymptomatic carriers in CDV epidemiology. A long-term follow-up using sensitive PCR and strict quarantine measures is of upmost importance in preventing the spread of infection. Dog owners and animal welfare organisations should be educated regarding the importance of complete vaccinations and the impact of dog imports on the spread of viral and vector-borne pathogens."
Molecular survey for the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) trypanosome parasites Crithidia mellificae and Lotmaria passim,"Honey bee populations in the United States have been fluctuating in recent years. Although this has not been attributed to any one cause, recent studies have shown that multiple interactions among mircoorganisms may contribute to their decline. Several honey bee internal parasites have been overlooked as probable causes of decline; these include two different species of trypanosomes Crithidia mellificae and Lotmaria passim. Both parasites have been understudied in honey bee populations and could contribute to population disease dynamics. This study explored a molecular diagnostic survey for C. mellificae and L. passim using multiplex-PCR. Honey bee samples from both feral and managed populations were collected from eight states. This is the first national honey bee trypanosome survey in the United States. A total of 1,360 samples were surveyed during this study in which, 11% were positive for L. passim; while no cases of C. mellificae were detected using multiplex-PCR analysis. Infection rates of states positive for L. passim ranged from 17% (New York) to 0.70% (Utah). Only one state (Mississippi) was not positive for L. passim. The proportion of positive L. passim samples was significantly different between managed and feral honey bee colonies. Results revealed that the honey bee parasitic trypanosome L. passim has a widespread distribution in the United States and should be considered as a potential contributor to honey bee health decline."
SYLVATIC AMERICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS IN ARGENTINA - TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI INFECTION IN MAMMALS FROM THE CHACO FOREST IN SANTIAGO-DEL-ESTERO,"Trypanosoma cruzi infection in sylvatic mammals of the quebracho woods of the eastern part of Santiago del Estero province, Argentina, was studied from October 1984 to December 1987. 301 mammals of 20 different species were caught. T. cruzi, characterized biologically and biochemically, was isolated by xenodiagnosis from 23 of 72 (32%) Didelphis albiventris opposums, 2/36 (5.5%) Conepatus chinga skunks, and one ferret (Galictis cuja). 53 opossum refuges were located and triatomine bugs were found in 2 of them: one male Triatoma infestans, infected with T. cruzi, and 5 uninfected nymphs of T. sordida, had all fed on opossum blood. Electrophoretic zymogram patterns of the T. cruzi populations isolated from opossums and skunks were similar to isoenzyme profiles already described for populations isolated from infected humans in Argentina. The small number of triatomines found in the opossum refuges seems inadequate to account for the prevalence of T. cruzi infection recorded for these mammals, so other possible contaminative routes of infection should be investigated."
"Spatial distribution of Triatoma guasayana (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in hardwood forest biotopes in Santiago del Estero, Argentina","In the study area Triatoma guasayana Wygodzinsky & Abalos is the only wild triatomine found sympatric with Triatoma infestans (Klug) in peridomestic premises. The Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas wild cycle is centered around the same biotopes occupied by T. guasayana, which are also visited mainly by opossums with annual prevalences of 29-50%. Twelve hectares were sampled for 4 consecutive years during all seasons. During that time, 420 T. guasayana individuals were collected in 11.3% of 1,188 biotopes of 4 types, which included quimiles (the cactus Opuntia quimilo), chaguares (several species of bromeliads), trees, and logs. Quimiles had the highest percentage of positive biotopes (31.5%) followed by chaguares (22.3%), whereas 5% of the logs were found infested. During all seasons, 9.6-15.2% of biotopes were found infested. Distance to artificial biotopes was not statistically significant when comparing the frequency of triatomine numbers per biotope in all biotope-season combinations. With the exception of quimiles in the fall, the mean number of triatomines was higher in chaguares during all seasons. Triatomine abundance by biotope and season strata showed a clumped distribution, except for the quimiles biotope during the summer. When pooling by seasons, the mean number of triatomines in chaguares and quimiles biotope was higher than in logs and trees, with all biotopes showing a strong clumped distribution. When pooling by biotopes, the mean number of T. guasayana was relatively similar for all seasons, with a strong clumped distribution. The strong contagious distribution of T. guasayana in the hardwood forest biotopes may explain the maintenance of the wild cycle of T. cruzi, despite the low numbers and the low prevalences of the insect vector."
Molecular epidemiology of Trypanosoma cruzi and Triatoma dimidiata in costal Ecuador,"Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. In Ecuador, Triatoma dimidiata and Rhodnius ecuadoriensis are the main vector species, responsible for over half of the cases of T. cruzi infection in the country. T. dimidiata is believed to have been introduced in Ecuador during colonial times, and its elimination from the country is thus believed to be feasible. We investigated here the molecular ecology of T. dimidiata and T. cruzi in costal Ecuador to further guide control efforts. Analysis of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS-2) of 23 specimens from Progreso, Guayas, unambiguously supported the likely importation of T. dimidiata from Central America to Ecuador. The observation of a very high parasite infection rate (54%) and frequent feeding on humans (3/5) confirmed a continued risk of transmission to humans. All genotyped parasites corresponded to TcI DTU and Trypanosoma rangeli was not detected in T. dimidiata. TcI subgroups corresponded to TcIa (25%), and mixed infections with TcIa and TcId (75%). Further studies should help clarify T. cruzi genetic structure in the country, and the possible impact of the introduction of T. dimidiata on the circulating parasite strains. The elevated risk posed by this species warrants continuing efforts for its control, but its apparent mobility between peridomestic and domestic habitats may favor reinfestation following insecticide spraying.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRYPANOSOME INFECTIONS OF THE TSETSE-FLY GLOSSINA-PALLIDIPES IN THE ZAMBEZI VALLEY,"The epidemiology of trypanosome infections of Glossina pallidipes was studied at a riverine site in the Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe for a period of 13 months. Over 9000 flies were captured using a single trap. These flies were dissected, screened for trypanosome infection, sexed, and aged using both wing fray and (for females) ovarian category indices. Midgut infections were identified to species using recently developed DNA probes. The overall prevalence of mature infections was 5.5%, comprising 3.1% Trypanosoma vivax-type and 2-4% T. congolense-type (which included very low prevalences of T. brucei, T. simiae and another Nannomonas species). The prevalence of infection increased with age. For T. vivax-type infections in flies aged by ovarian category this relationship could be described by a simple 'catalytic' model assuming a constant per capita rate of infection. For T. congolense-type infections this model tended to over-estimate prevalence in older age classes, implying that the rate of infection decreases with age, and/or that infected flies have higher mortality rates, and/or that a significant fraction of the population is resistant to infection. Prevalences of infection also varied between months. This variation was more marked for T. vivax-type infections and was negatively correlated with both temperature and rainfall. The shape of the age-prevalence relationship, however, did not vary significantly between months. These observations are not fully explained by variation in the age-structure of the tsetse population and are consistent with temporal variation in the rate of infection (rather than in the trypanosome developmental period or in effects of infection on fly mortality). Possible causes of this variation are discussed."
Distribution and abundance of trypanosome (subgenus Nannomonas) infections of the tsetse fly Glossina pallidipes in southern Africa,"Over 10 000 Glossina pallidipes tsetse flies were collected during two field studies in the Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe and one in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia. These were screened for mature trypanosome infections and 234 dot-blot preparations were made of infected midguts, which were screened using DNA probes or PCR with primers specific to different species or types of the trypanosome subgenus Nannomonas. Over 70% of midgut infections were successfully identified as either Trypanosoma godfreyi, T. simiae or three types of T. congolense, savannah, riverine-forest and Kilifi. The relative abundance of species and types did not vary significantly between study locations, habitat, season or tsetse age or sex, although there were differences between DNA probe and PCR results. Mixed species and/or mixed type infections were common and were more often defected using PCR. The distribution of infections among flies was highly aggregated, but there was no tendency for multiple infections to accumulate in older flies, implying that sequential superinfection may be uncommon. Possible explanations for these patterns are discussed."
Molecular detection of vector-borne agents in dogs from ten provinces of China,"Background: Although many vector-borne agents are potential zoonoses and cause substantial morbidity and mortality in dogs worldwide, there are limited data on these organisms in dogs of China. Methods: Quantitative PCRs for vector-borne agents were performed to investigate their prevalences in convenience whole blood samples obtained from 1114 dogs from 21 veterinary clinics and a commercial dog breeding facility in ten provinces of China. In addition, the PCRs were performed on 146 Rhipicephalus sanguineus senso lato and 37 Linognathus setosus collected from dogs in the commercial dog breeding facility. Results: DNAs of Babesia gibsoni and B. vogeli (1.2 %), Ehrlichia canis (1.3 %), Hepatozoon canis (1.8 %) and Theileria orientalis (0.1 %) or a closely related organism were detected in the bloods of the dogs studied, and Babesia vogeli (3.4 %) and Ehrlichia canis (4.1 %) in R. sanguineus senso lato. The qPCRs for Anaplasma spp., Dirofilaria immitis and Leishmania spp. were negative for all blood samples, ticks and lice. At least one vector-borne agent was found in dogs from 5 of the 10 provinces investigated in this study. Overall, 4.4 % (49/1117) of the dogs studied were positive for at least one vector-borne agent with the prevalence being highest in the commercial breeding colony (24/97; 24.7 %). Conclusions: Our study confirms that B. vogeli, B. gibsoni, H. canis, and E. canis occur in China. Also, we present evidence that T. orientalis or a closely related organism can infect dogs."
Triplex real-time PCR for detection of Crithidia mellificae and Lotmaria passim in honey bees,"Currently, light microscopic examination of cell morphology cannot discriminate Crithidia mellificae and Lotmaria passim with 100% certainty. Here, a minor groove-binding (MGB) probe-based multiplex real-time PCR assay was developed for the simultaneous and quantitative detection of C. mellificae and L. passim in honey bees. A conserved Hymenoptera 18S rRNA gene was built in as an internal control that allows accurate detection of PCR inhibition and failure of DNA extraction. The newly developed assay was also applied to field samples. Of 21 honey bee colonies (446 bees) sampled from six counties in both central and eastern Massachusetts, 3 colonies (14.29%) and 8 bees (1.79%) were infected with L. passim, and 1 colony (4.76%) and 1 bee (0.22%) with C. mellificae. Our data showed a low rate of trypanosomatid infection, and L. passim was more prevalent than C. mellificae in honey bee samples in Massachusetts."
Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi in raccoons from South Carolina and Georgia,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of American trypanosomiasis or Chagas' disease, is of both medical and veterinary importance as is evidenced by chronic phase myocarditis in humans and dogs. Further, T. cruzi has been reported from over 26 species of wildlife reservoir hosts in the USA, with raccoons (Procyon lotor) and opossums (Didelphis virginiana) being the most common. Whereas previous studies on T. cruzi in raccoons have included only culture and direct examination of blood, the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was used in the current study to detect anti-T. cruzi antibodies in the serum of raccoons. Of 221 raccoons trapped at 13 sites representing the five physiographic regions of South Carolina plus five sites in the Piedmont region of Georgia (from April 1997 to February 2000), 104 (47%) were seropositive. A higher seroprevalence in raccoons was observed in the coastal regions, with seroprevalence in the Lower Coastal Plain South (61%) being significantly higher than that in the Foothills (37%), Piedmont (42%), and Upper Coastal Plain (40%) regions. However, at a seroprevalence of 52%, the Lower Coastal Plain North was not significantly different from any other region. Although more female raccoons were infected than males, no statistical difference in prevalence was observed between sexes. The high seroprevalence of T. cruzi in raccoons, together with a few reports of wildlife isolates being infective for other wildlife species and domestic/laboratory annuals. suggests that risk of T. cruzi infection may be higher than previously suspected."
Comparison of serological methods and blood culture for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in raccoons (Procyon lotor),"The indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were compared with blood culture for the detection of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in 83 raccoons (Procyon lotor) trapped in 4 counties of southeast Georgia. Both IFAT and ELISA detected 24 of 25 culture-positive samples (96% sensitivity). Cultures from 25 raccoons (30%) were positive for epimastigotes, whereas a total of 50 raccoons (60%) was seropositive by either the IFAT or ELISA. Forty-five of 83 serum samples (54%) were positive for anti-T. cruzi antibodies with the ELISA, and 47 were IFAT positive (57%). Forty-two of the 50 seropositive raccoons (84%) were seropositive by both tests. Endpoint titers of IFAT-positive samples were determined by testing doubling dilutions from 1:40 to 1:1280. High titers of 640 and 320 were observed for 4 raccoons trapped in 1 county (St. Catherines Island, Liberty County) and titers of 160 for 1-2 raccoons from each of the 4 counties sampled. IFAT titers and ELISA optical density values were positively correlated. Both serological tests have a high sensitivity and should be excellent tools for studying the prevalence of T. cruzi in wildlife populations."
Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma evansi Infection in Equines of North and North Western States of India,"Trypanosomosis caused by Trypanosoma evansi, commonly known as ""surra,"" is a wasting disease affecting equids, camels, cattle, as well as several other domestic and wild animals. No systematic information is available on disease pattern in equines for development of control and treatment strategies in endemic areas in India. The present study was undertaken with a comprehensive plan to screen large population of equines using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to obtain epidemiological information on ""surra"" in different agro-climatic zones of India. A total of 6455 serum samples were tested, of them 338 (5.24%) were found positive for T. evansi antibodies during the years 2011-2012 to 2014-2015. The highest prevalence (9.75%) was recorded from Gangetic plains of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, while western dry region (Rajasthan) recorded the lowest (2.85%) prevalence rate. This study showed serological evidence of T. evansi infection in equines at a low prevalence rate, but the highest prevalence rate during the study was witnessed during 2011-2012. The disease was found prevalent throughout the year in different seasons with sporadic outbreaks in equines. However, higher prevalence was observed in postmonsoon season (September to November) and the lowest during winter season (December to February). Furthermore, no significant difference in disease prevalence was observed sex and species wise. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

"Seasonal variation of Leishmania major infection rates in sandflies from rodent burrows in Isfahan province, Iran","In preparation for field trials of killed Leishmania major vaccine, natural infections with Leishmania promastigotes were monitored in Phlebotomine sandfly vectors from villages of Borkhar rural district, northeast of Isfahan in central Iran, where L.major zymodeme MON-26 (=LON-1) has been identified as causing zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL). Sandflies were collected and dissected weekly, from burrows of rodent colonies, during the 'sandfly season', June-October 1991. Leptomonad infection rates were 12% of 26 Phlebotomus ansarii, 8% of 280 P.caucasicus, 11% of 1042 P.papatasi and none of 126 Sergentomyia sintoni, being greatest during late August through September, coinciding with peak activity of the sandflies, 2-3 months before the highest incidence of ZCL human cases in November-December."
Trypanosoma cruzi load in synanthropic rodents from rural areas in Chile,"Background: Trypanosoma cruzi is the agent of Chagas disease, a major public health problem in Latin America. Many wild and domestic animals are naturally infected with T. cruzi; rodents are one of the groups which have been consistently detected infected in different countries. The aim of this work was to characterize blood T. cruzi load in naturally infected rodents from a Chagas disease endemic region in Chile. Methods: Baited traps were set in domestic and peridomestic areas of rural dwellings. The rodents were anesthetized and blood sampled; DNA was extracted and the parasite load was quantified by T. cruzi satellite DNA real-time PCR assays. Results: Seventy-one rodents of four species, Rattus rattus, Mus musculus, Phyllotis darwini and Octodon degus, were captured; R. rattus was the most abundant species. Fifty-nine samples (83.1%) were T. cruzi-positive and the median value of the parasite load was 2.99 parasite equivalents (par-eq)/ml. The comparison of frequency of infection or parasite load by species showed no differences. However, one R. rattus presented very elevated parasitemia (1644 par-eq/ml). Conclusions: The overall levels of parasitemia were similar to those found in humans in Chile. The high infection levels in exotic and endemic rodents very near to rural settlements increases their relevance as T. cruzi hosts."

"Occurrence of Theileria parva and other haemoprotozoa in cattle at the edge of Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","Theileria pony, the most important bovine theilerial species in sub-Saharan Africa, causes widespread mortality and morbidity in endemic areas. A survey was conducted using buffy-coat specimens from 60 apparently healthy adult communally herded Nguni-type cattle at the northeastern edge of the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park to determine, by means of PCR and Reverse Line Blot (RLB) hybridisation, the occurrence of Theileria and Babesia species. The presence of Trypanosoma species was determined using PCR-RFLP Results showed that 6.7 % of the specimens were positive for Theileria parva. This significant finding suggests that cattle in South Africa, and not only African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer), may be subclinical carriers of T parva. Other species identified were T mutans (83.3 %), T. velifera (70.0 %), Theileria sp. (sable) (46.8 %) and T. taurotragi (1.7 %). Two specimens (3.3 %) were positive for Babesia bovis and single specimens (1.7 %) positive for B. bigemina and B. rossi, respectively. Mixed infections, of up to 4 species, were common (65.0 %). Only 1 specimen was found to be positive for Trypanosoma lynx, and 2 for T. theileri, of which only the first species is pathogenic."
Epidemiological patterns of canine leishmaniosis in Western Liguria (Italy),"An epidemiological survey was carried out on the distribution of canine leishmaniosis in Western Liguria (Northern Italy). Blood sera from 21146 dogs collected from 1990 to 1996 were subjected to the indirect immunofluorescence test (IFAT). From 1990 to 1994 (16690 dogs), only monthly seroprevalences were calculated (min 14%-max 60.5%). Dog sera sampled from October 1994 to May 1996 (4456 dogs) were divided into two subgroups (I: October 1994-May 1995; II: October 1995-May 1996). Seroprevalence was 30.3% and 22.1% in these two groups, respectively. Data analysis by log-linear models revealed that serological positivity to Leishmania sp. was significantly associated with a dog's outdoor lifestyle, with a rural environment and with the male sex. Of the 218 dogs which were tested twice seroconversion rates were also higher in outdoor, rural and male dogs while negativization rates were lower in the same groups. Basic reproductive numbers (R-0) were 1.53 (subgroup I) and 1.28 (subgroup II). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

"Molecular detection of Trypanosoma evansi based on ITS1 rDNA gene in Camelus dromedarius in Sistan Region, Iran","Trypanosomiasis is a disease caused by a flagellate protozoon called Trypanosoma and can be mechanically transmitted by vectors to humans and animals. Various species of Trypanosoma are found in livestock and poultry, which include Trypanosoma evansi, T. brucei, T. vivax and T. congolense. The camel is the most sensitive livestock for T. evansi, so the exact identification of infection is very important for epidemiological studies and the design of control programs. The present study was conducted with the aim of molecular detection of camel trypanosomiasis in the Sistan region in 2015. Previous studies have shown that internal transcribed spacer one (ITS1) of the ribosomal DNA is a reliable genetic marker for carrying out systematic molecular studies of trypanosomes. In order to investigate infections of camels with T. evansi, a total of 113 blood samples were collected randomly and the presence of parasites in each sample was evaluated using the microscopic method and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Genomic DNA was extracted and the ITS-1 was amplified by PCR. In comparison to the nucleotide sequence obtained with the sequences recorded in GenBank, it was determined that there is a 99% homology with the recorded sequence of T. evansi. The obtained sequence was registered in Gen Bank with kx900449 code. The T. evansi sequences from different countries such as India, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, China and Argentina and etc., were extracted from the Gene bank and aligned using the ClustalW2 sequence alignment tool and MEGA software. In this study the prevalence of T. evansi infection using the molecular method was 6.19% and no positive samples were found by microscopic observation."

Effect of season on the productivity of camels (Camelus dromedarius and the prevalence of their major parasites in Eastern Ethiopia,"The productivity and the prevalence rates of the major parasites of camels (Camelus dromedarius) kept under traditional management conditions at Errer valley, Ethiopia were assessed for a year (October 1997-September 1998). The daily milk offtake was significantly higher (p < 0.05) during the wet season (3.12 +/- 0.03 L) than during the dry season (1.49 +/- 0.04 L). Likewise, significantly higher (p < 0.05) daily weight gains (50.68 +/- 0.54 g) were observed during the wet season than during dry season in immature camels aged 1-4 years. Trypanosoma evansi, Sarcoptes scabiei and strongyle parasites were present throughout the year, but their prevalence rates were higher during the rainy months than during the dry months. The minimum and maximum point prevalence rates for T. evansi were 5.4% and 20.6%, respectively. Similarly, the point prevalence rates for S. scabiei also varied from 4.7% during the dry season to 21.7% during the rainy months. The highest strongyle egg counts per gram of faeces and highest point prevalence rate (85.7%) were observed in October, a rainy month, whereas the lowest number of eggs per gram of faeces and the lowest point prevalence rate (61.5%) were recorded in April, a dry month."
Epidemiological aspects of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis in Venezuela,
"Molecular detection, identification and phylogenetic inference of Leishmania spp. in some desert lizards from Northwest China by using internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) sequences","Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania is still endemic in Northwest China. It has been thought that reptiles could be a reservoir for mammalian leishmaniasis. However, data are still scarce on natural infection of lizards with Leishmania spp. in China. The present study deals with detection, identification and phylogenetic inference of Leishmania parasites at species and intraspecies levels isolated from six desert lizard species from 10 geographical locations in Northwest China using amplification and sequencing of ITS-rDNA. In total, 83 haplotypes were found among 137 ITS1 sequences obtained from up to 64.6% of all captured lizards. Representative sequences of Leishmania available in GenBank were compiled for comparison with the obtained haplotypes. Tree-based species delimitation was achieved by using Bayesian phylogenitc analyses and maximum parsimony approach. Phylogenetic trees congruently supported that the haplotypes were found to belong to three Leishmania species including L. (sauroleishmania) sp., Leishmania tropica and Leishmania donovani complex. A network approach revealed paraphyletic populations of L. (sauroleishmania) sp. and L tropica at intraspecies level regarding geographical origin and low host specificity. Chinese L. tropica from lizards showed significant heterogeneity as the obtained haplotypes were distributed in different clusters from other countries. Common ancestry was observed between some sequences of L. tropica from lizards and other sequence types from clinical samples from other countries. This may lend support to the potential reservoir role of lizards for human leishmaniasis. Our results appear to be the first molecular evidence for natural infection of lizards in Northwest China with reptilian Leishmania and mammalian Leishmania species. Desert lizards may be considered as putative reservoir hosts for Leishmania in China. Further studies on persistence of the Leishmania parasites in lizards and sandflies are recommended for the better understanding of their epidemiological involvement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Epidemiological Investigation of Asymptomatic Dogs with Leishmania Infection in Southwestern China Where Visceral Leishmaniasis is Intractable,"Heishui county, located in northwest Sichuan province, southwestern China, is an endemic area of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and is the most intractable area. VL is never destroyed in it. Asymptomatic dogs (Leishmania parasites have been diagnosed but clinically healthy) are considered to be a potential reservoir host in zoonotic VL area, and most can lead to infection of individuals, that is a new challenge for controlling VL in humans. The present study aimed to assess the Leishmania infection rate of asymptomatic dogs in Heishui county. Total 105 asymptomatic domestic dogs were gathered from 4 districts in Heishui county to investigate the infection rate with serological and molecular methods based on ELISA and kinetoplast minicircle DNA(kDNA) PCR, respectively. Out of 105 dogs, 44 (41.9%) were positive by more than 1 method; 21 (20.0%) were positive by ELISA, and 30 (28.6%) were positive by kDNA-PCR. Our study showed that Leishmania infection of domestic dogs which is clinically healthy is prevalent in the studied district, and the asymptomatic dogs infected by Leishmania may be the primary reason for the prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis in the area."
"Trypanosomes of non-human primates from the National Centre of Primates, Ananindeua, State of Para, Brazil","Trypanosome infections were sought in 46 non-human primates captured principally in Amazonian Brazil. Twenty-two (47.8%) were infected with four Trypanosoma species: T. cruzi, T. minasense, T. devei and T. rangeli. These preliminary results confirmed the high prevalence and diversity of natural infections with trypanosomes in primates from Brazilian Amazon and were the first formal record of simian infections with trypanosomes in the State of Acre. The presence of T. cruzi-like and T. rangeli-like parasites are recorded in four new hosts."
The infection rates of trypanosomes in squirrel monkeys at two sites in the Brazilian Amazon,"A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of natural infections by trypanosome species in squirrel monkeys: Saimiri sciureus (Linnaeus) and Saimiri ustus (Geoffroy) caught respectively near 2 hydroelectric plants: Balbina, in the State of Amazonas, and Samuel, in the Stale of Rondonia, Brazil. A total of 165 squirrel monkeys were examined by thick and thin blood smears (BS), haemocultures and xenodiagnosis: 112 monkeys, 67.9%, (being 52.7% with mix infections) were positive to trypanosomes. Four species of trypanosomes were found in monkeys from the 2 areas: Trypanosoma (Tejeraia) rangeli Tejera or T. rangeli-like parasites in 58 squirrel monkeys (35.2), Trypanosoma (Megatrypanum) minasense Chagas in 55 (33.3%), Trypanosoma (Herpetosoma) saimirii Rodhain or T. saimirii-like parasites in 53 (32.1%) and Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi Chagas in 17 (10.3%). As T. saimirii resembles T. minasense in blood-stream trypomastigotes and T. rangeli in cultural forms and in this survey almost all monkeys presenting trypanosomes morphologically indistinguishable from T. saimirii and/or T. minasense in BS were found through xenodiagnosis and/or haemoculture to be infected by T. rangeli, we suggest that the validity of T. saimirii needs to be evaluated."
Serological and entomological studies of canine leishmaniosis in Croatia,"In Croatia, canine leishmaniosis has been recognized in the southern littoral area (Dalmatia) as a re-emerging disease since 1997. This paper reports the findings of a survey carried out 2.5 years after the suspension of control measures for canine leishmaniosis. Entomological and cross-sectional serological surveys were carried out in the Kastela municipality in the Split-Dalmatia County (where stable foci of canine leishmaniosis were reported previously), and in a few localities from the Sibenik-Knin county where a few unstable foci were previously reported. Serological surveys detected a focus with 31% seropositive dogs in Rudine (the known enzootic area); a tendency for a new stable focus appearance in the Sibenik-Knin County (Rogoznica), with cumulative seropositivity of 13.5% in both areas. Entomological studies evidenced two competent Leishmania vectors, Phlebotomus neglectus and P tobbi; the first was prevalent (75.9%) being also the species much more associated to habitats where dogs are present. Moreover, prevalence for P neglectus females feeding on human blood reached 30%."
A seroepidemiologic survey of canine visceral leishmaniosis among apparently healthy dogs in Croatia,"Cross-sectional investigation was done on seroprevalence of Leishmania sp. infection among apparently healthy dogs in an area where canine leishmaniosis is endemic. Survey included 68 dogs living in the coastal city of Split, and 238 dogs living in 12 villages scattered in the hinterland. Each dog was clinically examined for the presence of some discrete signs compatible with leishmaniosis and by dot-ELISA modification determined the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies. The titre 1:600 and higher was regarded as positive in the study. The seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 42.85%, depending on the location. 54.34% of the seropositive dogs had moderately enlarged lymph nodes and/or some discrete changes on the skin. In our parasitological study, Leishmania sp. was isolated from several seropositive animals that had some clinical signs and from a few which did not have any. Data analysis revealed that serological positivity to Leishmania sp. was not associated with a dog's outdoor lifestyle and utility, but was associated with the gender and age. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Interaction between canine and human visceral leishmaniases in a holoendemic focus of Central Tunisia,
Distribution and identification of sand flies naturally infected with Leishmania from the Southeastern Peruvian Amazon,"Background Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an important health problem in the New World affecting civilian and military populations that are frequently exposed in endemic settings. The Peruvian region of Madre de Dios located near the border with Brazil is one of the most endemic CL regions in South America with more than 4,451 reported cases between 2010 and 2015 according to the Peruvian epidemiology directorate. However, little is known regarding the diversity and distribution of sand fly vectors in this region. In this study, we aimed to characterize the sand fly fauna in this endemic setting and identify sand fly species naturally infected with Leishmania possibly involved in pathogen transmission. Methods Sand fly collections were carried out during 2014 and 2015 in the communities of Flor de Acre, Villa Primavera, Mavila and Arca Pacahuara using CDC light traps and Shannon traps. Collected specimens were identified and non-blood-fed females were selected for Leishmania infection screening using kinetoplastid DNA-PCR (kDNA-PCR) and nested Real time PCR for species identification. Results A total of 10,897 phlebotomines belonging to the genus Lutzomyia (58 species) and Brumptomyia (2 species) were collected. Our study confirmed the widespread distribution and abundance of Lutzomyia (Trichophoromyia) spp. (24%), Lu. whitmani (19.4%) and Lu. yucumensis (15.8%) in the region. Analysis of Shannon diversity index indicates variability in sand fly composition across sites with Villa Primavera presenting the highest sand fly diversity and abundance. Leishmania screening by kDNA-PCR resulted in 45 positive pools collected from Flor de Acre (34 pools), Mavila (10 pools) and Arca Pacahuara (1 pool) and included 14 species: Lu. yucumensis, Lu. aragoi, Lu. sallesi, Lu. sherlocki, Lu. shawi, Lu. walkeri, Lu nevesi, Lu. migonei, Lu. davisi, Lu. carrerai, Lu. hirsuta, Lu. (Trichophoromyia) spp., Lu. llanosmartinsi and Lu. whitmani. Lutzomyia sherlocki, Lu. walkeri and Lu. llanosmartinsi had the highest infection rates (8%, 7% and 6%, respectively). We identified Leishmania guyanensis in two Lu. whitmani pools, and L. braziliensis in two Lu. llanosmartinsi pools and one Lu. davisi pool. Conclusions Based on our collections there is high sand fly diversity in Madre de Dios, with differences in sand fly abundance and species composition across sites. We identified 14 sand fly species naturally infected with Leishmania spp., having detected natural infection with L. (V.) guyanensis and L. (V.) braziliensis in three sand fly species. These results suggest the presence of several potential vectors that vary in their spatial and geographical distribution, which could explain the high prevalence of CL cases in this region."
"Occurrence of anti-Leishmania spp., Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in dog sera from Veterinary Hospital from Universidade Estadual de Londrina","The aim of this study was to detect the presence of IgG antibodies anti-Leishmania spp., Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum in dogs from a Veterinary Hospital from Universidade Estadual de Londrina. Blood samples from 112 animals were obtained by jugular venipuncture to obtain sera. The samples were tested by indirect immunofluorescence to detect antibodies anti-Leishmania spp., anti-N. caninum and anti-T. gondii. Thirteen (11.61%), 25 (22.32%), and 57 (50.89%) samples were positive for Leishmania spp., N. caninum, and T. gondii, respectively. The co-presence of anti-Leishmania spp. and N. caninum was observed in 6 (5.36%), anti-Leishmania spp. and anti-T. gondii in 8 (14.7%), and anti-N. caninum and anti-T. gondii in 18 (16.07%) samples. The co-presence of anti-Leishmania spp., anti-N. caninum and anti-T. gondii was observed in 5 (4.46%) dogs. There was a higher prevalence of Leishmania in Toxoplasma and Neospora positive animals, however, these results were not statistically significant (range p = 0.052 p = 0.06). The dogs have an important role in the epidemiological cycle of these diseases, which are important in animal and public health. The northern state of Parana is an endemic area for human cutaneous leishmaniasis, therefore, studies should be conducted to uncover the real role of dogs as reservoirs of Leishmania to humans in the state."
