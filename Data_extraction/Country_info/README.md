This is a working code; I wrote it to extract location (by country) from each study

Its working but there is another way to export the list of extracted countries into an excel column. Limitation: The method I used is not optimum (errors in separating items to diff cells: must be corrected manually with data separation function in excel) but it saves time. In addition, I manually verified the accuracy of data extraction manually to ensure there is no mistakes.
