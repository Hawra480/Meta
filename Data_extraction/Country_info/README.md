# data-extraction-by-country-info
this is a working code, I wrote it to extract location (by country)from each study

its working but I need to find another way to export the list of exctracted countries into an excel colo
the method I used is not optimum (errors in separating items to diff cells:must be corrected manually).
# I should look for another approach to export list as colum in excel.
