# data-extraction-by-country-info
This is a working code, I wrote it to extract location (by country)from each study

Its working but there is another way to export the list of exctracted countries into an excel column.
Limitation: The method I used is not optimum (errors in separating items to diff cells:must be corrected manually  with data sepration function in excel) but it saves time. In addition I  manually varifed the accuracy of the extraction manually to ensure there is no mistake.
# Note to  myself: I should maybe look for another approach to export list as colum in excel.
