# ML_updated1
This is an updated code for ML using sklearn module, this module has most of the functions already defined so I stopped the work on my previous code with functions dufentions (as I was defining functions one by one ). 

The accuracy of ML inclusion based on the training is appro 80%.All included studies by ML, or based on human decision will be subjected to title and abstract review and if still eligible for inclusion will be subjected to full text review.

In this directory there are the following: 

1- model selection code: this is the code where I tested several Algorithm/models to see which one can be trained best for our data to give high accuracy of inclusion prediction. based on model selection_test I used one module
2- Algorithm comparison graph(png)
3-input file named ML_screening1.csv
4-Training and prediction code


5-Confusion matrix code and figure were uploaded. 
6-Extended notes on current protocl and future recomendation for futur protocols are added.
